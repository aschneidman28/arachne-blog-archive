If you are on a plan with one of the providers that offers you basically a no-cost upgrade I'd say yes as well.\n\nBut if you have any iPhone with better than 80% of its original battery capacity left, that can connect to 5G, and you are satisfied with the pictures it takes, you are not missing out by skipping this one. And if Apple really disagreed with me they would have found a way to ship these phones with their marquee Intelligence features.\n\nI used to circle the date of new iPhone releases and salivate at the thought of having one of the precious new ones in my hands as soon as was humanly possible. This is no longer the case for me personally and is reflected by the generally subdued response this year's phone reveal had.\n\n\nTo close out Warp 1\n\nJust want to say thanks again for all of you that get this newsletter. I sincerely appreciate it.\n\nA few quick things:\n\n 1. I'd love to hear from you! Feel free to drop me a voice memo or email at alex@alexschneidman.com\n 2. Share Arachne with your friends, coworkers, employees, pets, or AI companions.\n 3. If you haven't yet, sign up to attend my first Arachne live session on October 21. Here's the link:\n\nlive sessions — alex schneidmanalex schneidman0\n\nSee you Thursday for Weft 1!\n\nCallouts:\n\n🤫*The iPhone 15 Pro models will be receiving Apple Intelligence features.

As mentioned in Tuesday's post, the newsletter is taking on a new format. Tuesday is Warp day, Thursday (today) is Weft day. Warps = current events, news of the week. Wefts = vibey meditations on larger scale ideas. Fridays I'll send out a Weekend Reading post.\n\nYou may be wondering what's with all the textile vernacular? Why is the newsletter called Arachne, the name of the mythological weaver who was turned into a spider? What does any of this have to do with the internet?\n\nWithout getting too self obsessive, it's because the textile and the tech industries are more connected than it might appear. Early mechanizations of textile manufacturing, from the spinning jenny to the sewing machine itself, are progenitors of the computer revolution. The Jacquard Loom, for example, was an early 19th century device that used punch cards to execute complex woven patterns.\n\nIn the mythological story of Arachne, Arachne is an incredible seamstress and weaver who challenges the goddess Athena to a weave off. Arachne's tapestry is so flawless, so beautiful that Athena pops off and beats Arachne with her own shuttle. There's other details but the story is about hubris and becoming too boastful in the face of the gods yada yada. I hope not to become too boastful in the face of the gods.\n\nAdditionally, I wanted to honor the early 20th century Jewish immigrants to the United States for whom the textile industry offered a means of economic advancement. Just like the tech industries, the textile industry is, to this day, built off of the backs of underpaid and exploited labor across the globe. I hope to honor this ancestral memory by speaking truth to today's reality.\n\nLet's get into today's post.\n\n\nWhy should you have a website?\n\nOver the last few weeks, I have been reinvesting my time in helping friends and family with their websites.\n\nIt's important that I say here that the extent of my curent capability building or maintaining a site is all done through low- and no-code platforms like Squarespace. I do not have the full stack developer skills required to really go all the way. But I do have an eye for design, a pretty solid understanding of how websites actually function, and the general trends of the overall online experience.\n\nWhich is why I say: If you are a creative individual of any type, you need a website. Here's why.\n\nYour Audience\n\nIn October of 2022, Elon Musk bought Twitter for $44 billion. Prior to this acquisition, Twitter was a publicly traded company run by a board of directors, a CEO, and multiple C-Suite level executives covering legal, operations, and more. Because of the nature of this organizational structure, Twitter had a litany of stakeholders to contend with in order to operate. For example, because most of its revenue was derived from advertising, Twitter needed to maintain positive relationships with large brands and make Twitter a somewhat chill place for users to scroll on and tweeters to tweet on. Because it was publicly owned, Twitter was beholden to shareholders who had a literal vested interest in the success of the platform. Thus this little business loop is formed: Twitter needs to keep its advertisers happy so that it can keep its shareholders happy and along the way keep its users happy.\n\nThen Elon Musk bought the platform, disbanded basically all of the existing organizational structure, and made the company private. Now it's incentive structure is all fakakta. Instead of keeping a bunch of people happy, Twitter's whole operation exists in service of Elon Musk. And as has become evident, he doesn't seem all that motivated by money. He has made Twitter a more hostile place, both passively allowing misinformation to spread and actively swimming in the kind of anti-semitic, bro-fascist, edge-racist bullshit that makes it past the post over there now.\n\nIf you're a creative worker - you are a writer of funny tweets, you use Twitter to share your fan art, you breakdown baseball plays in a clever way - you now have a difficult problem. Do I dig my heels in on this platform? My audience is here, but I can already see them leaving this place. I spend hours here every day. How can I amass this follower account somewhere else?\n\nWhat Twitter's long and drawn out death demonstrates is that we cannot trust these individual companies or entities with the audiences we work to build. As the internet decentralizes from these outlets, with new places like Bluesky or Mastodon cropping up, creative workers need to be able to gain, retain, and grow their audience on their own terms.\n\nHaving a basic website does not immediately solve for this problem, but it does help. Building up a list of your contacts, your audience members, or your fans is integral in industries so dependent on network effects. By having your own website and deploying newsletter, microblogging, or member area functionality you can begin to take ownership over your little corner of the world.\n\nYour Work\n\nGenerally speaking, every single thing you put online becomes accessible data for major web indexing companies like Google, AI behemoths like OpenAI, and social networking companies like Meta. This is true even if you use your own website, as the very fact that your site may be reachable via a Google search demonstrates that Google itself has seen and scraped a little bit of your site.\n\nBut in the context of the creative industries it is important to consider the ramifications of sharing your work on social.\n\nApple, Nvidia, Anthropic Used Thousands of Swiped YouTube Videos to Train AI“It’s theft.” A WIRED investigation found that subtitles from 173,536 YouTube videos, siphoned from more than 48,000 channels, were used by Anthropic, Nvidia, Apple, and Salesforce to train AI.WIREDCondé Nast\n\nIf you have posted an image on Instagram, if you have made a YouTube video, if you have tweeted a tweet, it can be said with pretty good certainty that your work has been used by some mechanism to train artificial intelligence.

First, there must be a variety of venues, with sizes ranging from small to large and vibes ranging from DIY to formal. Think grungy basements AND glitzy proscenium theaters. Think a coffee shop that closes at 4pm and a bar that closes at 4am.</p><h4 id=\"costs\">Costs</h4><p>The costs to access these venues must be kept low. For venue owners, rents and property costs should be low. For the artists, there must not be a \"pay-to-play\" structure in place, the common practice of artists having to pay fees to perform or show their work. For audiences, there must not be exorbitant cover charges or overhead costs to participate in the scene.</p><h4 id=\"healthy-urbanization\">Healthy urbanization</h4><p>Finally, and in my opinion most importantly, localities must engage in healthy urbanization to promote an arts scene. While Byrne specifically cites affordable housing and anti-gentrification policy, I would add excellent public transit, public funding for the arts, and access to child/pet care.</p><hr><p>For many of you reading this, you may be thinking <em>Well, wouldn't that be fantastic!</em> If you live in Chicago or New York, for example, you have experienced a widening gap of wealth inequality, the destruction of mid-tier arts spaces, and dramatic increases to the cost of living.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-embed-card\"><iframe src=\"https://www.nytimes.com/svc/oembed/html/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2023%2F07%2F23%2Ftheater%2Fregional-theater-crisis.html\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" title=\"A Crisis in America’s Theaters Leaves Prestigious Stages Dark\" style=\"border:none;max-width:500px;min-width:300px;min-height:550px;display:block;width:100%;\"></iframe></figure><p>While the New York Times reports here that Chicago lost at least half a dozen store-front theaters as a result of the pandemic, anecdotal evidence suggests it is far, far more.

Haven't missed a deadline yet!\n\nThis week's piece is the one I am proudest to share so far. I could probably write ten thousand words on this topic, and I probably will someday, but for now here's around 1,500.\n\nLet's go.\n\nIn his book How Music Works, David Byrne writes a chapter called \"How to Make a Scene.\" In this chapter, Byrne reflects on the New York City music scene of the 1970s and 1980s and the many factors that made it a fertile landscape for artists such as himself, Patti Smith, and the Ramones.\n\nHere are a few characteristics that Byrne outlines:\n\nVenues\n\nByrne's observations about venues break down into a few key concepts. First, there must be a variety of venues, with sizes ranging from small to large and vibes ranging from DIY to formal. Think grungy basements AND glitzy proscenium theaters. Think a coffee shop that closes at 4pm and a bar that closes at 4am.\n\nCosts\n\nThe costs to access these venues must be kept low. For venue owners, rents and property costs should be low. For the artists, there must not be a \"pay-to-play\" structure in place, the common practice of artists having to pay fees to perform or show their work. For audiences, there must not be exorbitant cover charges or overhead costs to participate in the scene.\n\nHealthy urbanization\n\nFinally, and in my opinion most importantly, localities must engage in healthy urbanization to promote an arts scene. While Byrne specifically cites affordable housing and anti-gentrification policy, I would add excellent public transit, public funding for the arts, and access to child/pet care.\n\nFor many of you reading this, you may be thinking Well, wouldn't that be fantastic! If you live in Chicago or New York, for example, you have experienced a widening gap of wealth inequality, the destruction of mid-tier arts spaces, and dramatic increases to the cost of living.\n\nWhile the New York Times reports here that Chicago lost at least half a dozen store-front theaters as a result of the pandemic, anecdotal evidence suggests it is far, far more. On top of that, institutions like the beloved Lookinglass Theater have dramatically scaled back production offerings. In New York, even prior to the pandemic, small local performance spaces in Midtown and beyond have faced devastation. Last year, the Public Theatre, the nation's most famous non-profit theatre organization, notable for first staging Hamilton, running Shakespeare in the Park, and offering unparalleled artistic development opportunities, cut 19% of its full time staff. Right here in my current home of New Haven, the storied Long Wharf Theatre has had to exit its longtime home on its namesake Long Wharf.\n\nBut the greater tragedy, in my opinion, lies in the mid and lower tier spaces that have disappeared, the ones that do not get write ups in the nation's paper of record. Places in Chicago like Emerald City Theatre or The House Theatre. And these are just theatre spaces.\n\nAccording to a report done by the office of the New York State Comptroller, Thomas DiNapoli, average housing expenditures in New York City grew 68.4% in the time between 2011-2012 and 2021-2022. Consider this alongside New York's unequal bounce back from the pandemic, as outlined in this article from the Times.\n\nIssues cited in this article include the stagnation of the minimum wage, rising inflation, and the limits of available jobs to meaningfully build wealth.\n\nWhile I'm sorry to keep harping on New York, there are even more government and local failings that show echoes throughout the country, making the development of an arts scene so difficult.

This week, I want to explore how technology can improve our real life communities.\n\nThe lay of the land\n\nThere is evidence to suggest that American communities are extraordinarily divided.\n\nDisconnected: The Growing Class Divide in American Civic Life - The Survey Center on American LifeDisconnected: Places and Spaces presents new survey findings that suggest Americans are less connected than ever before.The Survey Center on American Life - A nonprofit organization dedicated to understanding the way cultural, political, and technological changes are shaping the lives of ordinary Americans.Daniel A. Cox, Sam Pressler\n\nBetween class divisions, political divisions, and remnant mid-century racial divisions, Americans are spending less and less time in community with each other. Third spaces (non-home, non-work public places conducive to chit chat and social gatherings) are drying up.\n\nThe unfortunate, ongoing disappearance of ‘third places’People are losing the sublime art of hanging outThe WeekDevika Rao, The Week US\n\nMuch has been written about how and why this trend is taking place. There's the glaringly obvious one: the pandemic. And then there are others, including:\n\n * The rise of online spaces like social media and social gaming\n * Wealth inequality\n * Decimation of public funding in parks, libraries, and arts spaces\n * Prioritization of car infrastructure over pedestrian infrastructure\n * Cost of living/rent and property expenses\n\nWith the growth of so-called technological \"solutions\" like video doorbells and Nextdoor, increasingly antagonistic rhetoric from fascistic political opportunists, and the ease with which an individual can shut out the outside world, it is no wonder that things feel more chaotic than they used to.\n\nFor many people older than I am (28, by the way), they can readily call to mind what it was actually like to live through the 1960s and 1970s. These were times of unprecedented division, violence, and chaos that yes, do echo in our lives now. Coast to coast: economic uncertainty, nuclear threats, legalized racial segregation, political violence and assassination. The literal draft. Despite all of this, these people had pretty thriving \"third spaces.\" These decades comprise the early visions people of my generation have of kids on bikes, out getting into trouble until sundown.\n\nHow can we get some of that back? How can our communities and neighborhoods wake up from under the heavy blanket of fiber optics and 5G and push notifications? Here are some ideas and the technology that can supercharge them.\n\nSaving local news\n\nLocal News Has Been Destroyed. Here’s How We Can Revive It.A plan to build back better.The NationJohn Nichols\n\nLocal news organizations have been absolutely destroyed. There are so, so many reasons for this, but the most important ones include reduced funding for professional journalism, right-wing media conglomeration, and the collapse of the traditional news business model.\n\nLet's talk business models for a second. In the past, you'd pay a low recurring fee to have the newspaper delivered to your building or house. That newspaper would come with advertisements and classified listings that would supplement the paper's costs. The more widely distributed your newspaper, the more you could charge for ads/classifieds, the more sustainable your business.\n\nThen the internet happened. Or more specifically, Google happened. Google became the sole middle entity for advertising on the internet, serving ads to practically every news org both large and small. With this monopoly, they have been able to squeeze as much profit out of serving their ads as possible. This also disrupts the incentives of news organizations. In order to maximize the revenue they get from Google, online news platforms are forced to produce increasingly sensationalist, under-reported, emotionally engaging slop for people to click on.\n\nIn the last few years, the more well equipped news orgs like The New York Times or The Washington Post have pivoted. They have conglomerated news outlets, as in NYT's purchase of The Athletic. They have increased the cost of their subscriptions and put most of their work behind paywalls. They have produced more sponsored content, in which whole articles are dressed to look like news but are actually advertisements. They have creating gaming platforms. Their opinion columnists have put out the stupidest, most rage inducing bait to drive traffic.\n\nWhere does this leave smaller local news orgs? The ones without name recognition. The ones who might never have had full time staff except for maybe one kook who just loved doing it?\n\nWho is currently on the ground in Western North Carolina or central Florida combatting storm misinformation? Not because they are a coastal New York Times transplant but because they are a member of the community?\n\nIn order to reverse course on this, we must (must) (MUST) invest in public media. We must re-invigorate the National Endowment for the Arts that gave us myriad public access media institutions like Sesame Street. We must offer grants and lenient tax incentives for the founding of non-profit news organizations like Gothamist. We must empower journalists exiting universities in the country's biggest metropolises to get paid and have editorial support in small localities across the country.\n\nTechnology has made it easier to distribute ideas, and standing up an online publishing institution comes with so many fewer barriers of entry than it used to (for better and for worse). We must leverage the power of local government and local organizing to bring back the type of engaged, empathetic local reporting for which this country used to lead the world.\n\nMini ISPs\n\nIt is taken as a given that there are a small class of internet service providers who get to pipe connectivity to our homes. You know their names, they are some of the country's biggest companies both in revenue and in employment.\n\nDepending on where you live, you may only have one single choice for your internet. In my case, my building is exclusively wired for Comcast's Xfinity service. In fact, I even tried to get Frontier but they came all the way to my apartment to tell me that they couldn't offer me service.\n\nWithout getting into the weeds on why these regional ISP monopolies are bad, I invite you to consider the problems that come with enormous national conglomerates having control over the way people interact with products, connect with others, and spend their time.\n\nFor example, compare the experience you might have buying a TV from Target with buying the TV from Uncle Tony's Ye Olde Electronic Shoppe. We've come to understand that smaller, more locally owned operations tend to treat their customers with more dignity, tend to be more responsive to community needs, and tend to be more knowledgeable on the goods or services they provide. And they have incentives to! The Target down the road is turning over staff, the dollars you're spending there are mostly going to corporate in Minneapolis, and they likely don't have someone working there with the expertise of Uncle Tony who has been hawking his electronics for a generation.\n\nThese same things can be true of internet service providers. By funding mesh networks and establishing locally owned and operated means for high speed internet, the very nature of connection between people is brought to a local level. Imagine, for a moment, knowing the name of the person who is in charge of your ISP. Plus, since it's unlikely that Aunt Judy's Internet Company is a mega corporation that also owns NBCUniversal or something like it, you could end up paying way less!\n\nAfter taking this step we can also begin to imagine hitching the development of local news and arts to the mini ISP wagon. This, after all, is similar to how cable started in the 70s/80s anyway.\n\nAnd for what it is worth, this is not a far fetched notion. There are communities already doing this. Here is an example:\n\nNode by NodeWhat happened to Brooklyn’s disaster-proof mesh Wi-Fi network?The Verge🗒️Note: I personally think that internet access ought to be treated like a public good, akin to water, electricity, and fire departments.

Let's Warp.\n\nLast week, Tesla and its actively-democracy-undermining CEO Elon Musk hosted an event to unveil multiple daydreams of actual products.\n\nOriginally planned for August, the event featured the marquee reveal of the Tesla Cybercab. The vision of the Cybercab, or at least of the prototype that they showed off, is one of privately owned autonomous vehicles. Alongside the traditional taxi fleet model (\"Tesla Network\"), Musk has repeatedly made the pitch that your car could function as a sort of AirBnB on wheels, making local rides for people in your neighborhood after it drops you off at work or something. He's also floated the bewildering idea of the cars functioning as mobile AI computing nodes. Perhaps I have to explain why this is a horrible idea that would not work, but at the very least I ask you to consider which of your computers is at constant risk of an uninsured Nissan Rogue completely destroying it.\n\nMusk has been making the claim for almost a decade that \"full self driving,\" or FSD, is just around the corner. It is not. I cannot stress enough that it is not. Not for Tesla at the very least.\n\nTesla also showed off their Robovan concept. It's an autonomous van. With those 6-8 inches of clearance off the ground I can't wait to see it deal with any number of real-world road surprises. Like, I don't know, the slight incline of a hotel driveway or a pothole.\n\nBut honestly, Tesla has a long history of showing off products and features that either never make it to the streets or arrive with any number of flaws. This is not new or news. So let's talk about the robots.\n\n\nOptimus crime\n\nTesla’s Optimus bot makes a scene at the robotaxi eventOptimus might have some new tricks.The Verge\n\nMarching out with the steady cadence of pop culture's greatest mechanical villains, the humanoid Optimus robot was the social media star of Tesla's event. If you go on Twitter, you'll see a number of Elon's other bots extolling the merits of all the immigrant labor, bartending, and other jobs they view as subhuman being replaced by these guys.\n\nFirst, I should say: these robots are mechanically very impressive. Stop to consider how many upright, bipedal animals millions of years of evolution have produced. It's basically us and kangaroos. For a number of biomechanical reasons, balancing all of a locomotive being's weight on what amounts to two little flaps is extraordinarily difficult. As we can see from Earth's extraordinary biodiversity, things with 4+ legs tend to win out.\n\nPast bipedal robots like Atlas from Boston Dynamics are short, keep their center of gravity very low, and are in a constant plié (that's a bended knee for all of you who haven't taken a ballet class). So the simple fact that these things have basically human proportions and appear to move in a humanoid way, granted under perfectly ideal circumstances, is pretty impressive.\n\nEverything else about them is dumb as hell.\n\nThe Optimus robots at Tesla’s Cybercab event were humans in disguiseThe robots were just a little too slick.The Verge\n\nWhen we look just at the presentation of these robots at the event, they are very clearly incredibly fancy puppets. As noted in the article above, all of the robots respond to verbal questions immediately. As of right now, absolutely zero AI models can respond with the inflection and immediacy that these robots do. Very evidently what is happening here is the robots are being remotely operated by live humans. Consider the hilarious irony of a man showing off the humanoid robots he swears will replace silly human labor by employing humans to do the silly task of pretending to be robots. You can find similar technology similarly implemented at Disneyworld.\n\nBut maybe I'm being too harsh. This is just a proof of concept! With more advancements in AI and in robotics, maybe these things really can be what they are pretending to be. But even if this is the case, is that what we even want?\n\n\nIt won't be humanoid robots\n\nDecades (centuries even!) of culture have given us troves of iconic humanoid robot fare. There is something primordial, something basic about us that lead us back down this path of imagination. What is the Frankenstein story if not a vision of what it might be like to create as God creates? What is the Golem of Jewish folklore if not our manifestation of the super human? We are constantly dreaming, constantly iterating on the function and utility of being human. It is at once a search for purpose and a bleak indication of the lack thereof for us to continue building a battery powered image of ourselves. As robots, we can escape death, we can lift cars, we can do Terminator stuff, or whatever.\n\nThere is one main reason that humanoid robots ain't it, and that's that the human form sucks at a lot of stuff.\n\nLet's talk about laundry. Here's a basic breakdown of how I do it:\n\n 1.  I gather all of my dirty clothes in one place, maybe a hamper or laundry basket. Sometimes I organize by color but who is really doing all that.\n 2.  I put a powdered disinfectant in the washer.\n 3.  I place my dirty clothes in the drum.\n 4.  I drip some detergent into the drum.\n 5.  Based on what's being washed, I turn some knobs on my machine and turn it on.\n 6.  About 35 minutes later, I take the clothes that need to be hung dried out and place them on a drying rack.\n 7.  I make sure the drier thing has all the lint removed.\n 8.  I put the clothes that go in the drier into the drier.\n 9.  Based on what's being dried, I turn some knobs on my machine and turn it on.\n 10. Sometime later, when everything is dry, I fold it up and put it where it needs to go.\n\nConsider what this does to a human body and mind. You have to stoop down, carry stuff, move things around, know where stuff goes, know where stuff is, know how your specific washing machine/drier work. Your body has to know the range or force your hand needs to exert on the door to open and close it. Your eyes need to know the exact amount of detergent you intend to put into the machine.\n\n🧺A little inside baseball, but this past summer I gave myself a concussion while doing laundry. I've thought about laundry plenty. I got laid off, sue me.\n\nIn order to get a humanoid robot to do these things, it needs to understand so much about the world. And not just \"the world,\" but your world.

Twelve knives were recovered. No guns were recovered.\n\nZero guns! Not a one! 12 knives and 118 false positives! Of those 12 knives, zero arrests were made, implying that 0 of those 12 were possessed illegally.\n\nSo 118 people were stopped unnecessarily, a big chunk of the city's budget didn't go to something useful, and the AI part of this didn't even work!\n\nThis final story is incredibly sad. Here's a little bit of context.\n\nOne use case of AI chatbots is to have them role play as different characters. This is the foundational product of the company character.ai. Character.ai offers a wide variety of AI chatbots that will interact with users as if they are \"real\" people. A quick glance at the site will show you that these chatbots often take on the personae of animated characters or cultural archetypes, which can be a draw for younger audiences.\n\nYou can read the excellent reporting that Kevin Roose at the New York Times did above, but I want to highlight one of the failures of not just character.ai, but technology companies everywhere.\n\nThese companies do not tend to prioritize safety, even when they know their user base may skew younger. They prioritize new features, innovative ideas, and a kind of \"move fast and break things\" mentality that has remained popular amongst Silicon Valley companies. This is extraordinarily irresponsible, especially when deploying AI that may act in unpredictable ways.\n\nOur government has a number of regulations that are meant to protect consumers. Our food industry, our automotive industry, our early childhood industry; all of them are required to meet certain standards of local, state, and/or federal regulation in order to operate. While twenty years ago it may have been preposterous to think of media or software technology companies as requiring this kind of regulation, recent history has provided more than enough evidence that we need oversight of these companies.\n\nIf AI and technology companies are going to be responsible stewards of innovation, we must collectively hold them accountable. My heart breaks for this boy and his mother. This should never have happened.\n\nWe are being bombarded with messaging that AI is here to fix our problems. I get a number of ads each day promising that Watsonx intelligence will open up new insights for me and my business, or whatever. I am sure that it will. But alongside this AI evangelism, we must remain present and skeptical of these new developments. We cannot have the good and ignore the bad.","feature_image":"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1542168300-b6d2279063af?crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&fit=max&fm=jpg&ixid=M3wxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDJ8fG55YyUyMHN1YndheXxlbnwwfHx8fDE3MzAxMzEzOTN8MA&ixlib=rb-4.0.3&q=80&w=2000","featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","email_recipient_filter":"all","created_at":"2024-10-28T15:57:11.000Z","updated_at":"2024-10-29T12:55:40.000Z","published_at":"2024-10-29T12:55:40.000Z","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null,"newsletter_id":"66f029f981a59700086b0e28","show_title_and_feature_image":1},{"id":"6723b071d880110001081d36","uuid":"e9781475-98ae-452d-82e6-a28d3665a571","title":"A second Trump presidency would be disastrous for the tech industry","slug":"a-second-trump-presidency-would-be-disastrous-for-the-tech-industry","mobiledoc":null,"lexical":"{\"root\":{\"children\":[{\"children\":[{\"detail\":0,\"format\":0,\"mode\":\"normal\",\"style\":\"\",\"text\":\"This post was slightly delayed because I've been sick all week from my Covid/Flu shots.

Apologies!\n\nHi there! While the halls of America's best and brightest billionaire owned newspapers shuffle their feet wondering if capitulating to a fascist is a good idea, you can rest assured that that bullshit won't grace the revered pixels of Arachne.\n\nThis newsletter, and the person who writes it, is so vehemently pro-democracy that (gasp) he is willing to say it publicly. Seeing as it's unclear who gets what first amendment rights under a Trump presidency, I seek to honor the legacy of people who had it way worse than I did and still said whatever their version of a Thursday newsletter written from their couch was.\n\nDonald Trump and his cronies are fascistic losers who are telling us out loud that they plan to deport upwards of 13 million immigrants, restrict medical access, and completely dissolve the power of the federal government to, uh, do things. So, beyond all of the heinous, racist horseshit Trump is empowering a legion of America's worst law school graduates to put in action, let's talk tech. In no particular order, here are some ways a Trump presidency would be horrific for tech in this country and potentially set back our global advantage while hurting consumers.\n\n\nChevron\n\nChevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc. was a Supreme Court case that set an incredibly meaningful precedent in the litigation of issues related to government agencies. You may have heard of it in the last year, since it was overruled by the current SCOTUS this past summer.\n\nHere's my incredibly basic understanding of how it worked: When interpreting language used in the legislation or policy that empowered a government agency, the courts would \"defer\" to the agency's interpretation of that language when making rulings. If you think about it, this makes sense. People hired by or appointed to the EPA or the FDA (you hope) have greater expertise on their field of regulation than some random appellate court judge might. But the recent overruling said \"actually, forget that.\"\n\nSo, in theory, lets say one of Trump's biggest donor cheerleaders was a man who owned an electric vehicle company and a space exploration company with multiple government contracts and under multiple regulatory bodies. Let's also say that that man wanted to build a car that could, say, drive on its own. This hypothetical individual could bring a case against, say, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration that certain policies it enforces about automobile safety are too restrictive on innovation, or whatever. He could, say, bring that case up in Texas or Florida where his businesses operate, find a favorable judge, and successfully challenge the NHTSA. In the past, the precedent would have been for this judge to defer to the agency's interpretation of their regulations.\n\nNow you may be wondering: Hasn't SCOTUS already made this decision? It doesn't matter who is in the White House if this precedent has already been changed! And you bring up a good point. But consider the following.\n\nThe Executive Branch not only appoints who runs these critical government agencies, but also judges who might decide the cases brought against them. Trump spent his presidency appointing dozens and dozens of compliant losers to benches across the country, including, obviously, the Supreme Court itself, who are still presiding. Under a second Trump Presidency, you could have someone who thinks pasteurized milk is bad for you running the FDA. So even before legal challenges get to a favorable court, the government agencies could just roll over. And if they don't, a judge who is more interested in glad-handing Trump than in protecting consumers may disregard established understanding of policy to rule in the challengers' favor.\n\nWe have multiple government agencies that interact with the tech and media spaces, the NHTSA is one, so is the FCC, so is the SEC, so is the DoE.

This one will probably not be as elegantly written as past posts.\n\n✍️A quick editorial note:\nדעם מאַשין קילז פאַשיסץ\n\n\nSome Things to Prepare For\n\nA Trump presidency is bad in untold ways. We know this because we already had one. People who would not have otherwise suffered will likely suffer. Our tenuous democratic experiment will prevail, but under dire stress and only through the sleepless commitment of resistance. The country is likely to be less healthy and less educated.\n\nThe tech and media industries are in for an interesting few years. As individual consumers and producers in these industries, here are some things to prepare for.\n\nElon Musk is about to be even more annoying\n\nIt is a core editorial tenet of Arachne that Elon Musk sucks and is bad. Hurray for the First Amendment, because I'm gunna be saying that over and over the next four years. The ways in which he currently sucks will be exacerbated by his close proximity to the president-elect.\n\nYou may wonder why Elon Musk has thrown his heaving billions behind Donald Trump. Other than the fact that decadent piss-babies whose own families despise them tend to run in the same circles, Musk is trying to curry favor with Trump in order to advantage his own businesses. The Biden administration, your typical bureaucratic executive branch, has mostly allowed the tools of the federal government to operate normally. Democrats love The Rules, after all. This often means that Elon's brilliant ideas about his cars that can't drive themselves or his satellites that are actively aiding the Russian military campaign in Ukraine run up against regulatory power and the many gears and levers of a half functioning federal government. Under Trump, as under all authoritarians, it is most important to caress the ego of just one guy. Armed with Supreme Court decisions that basically said \"Trump appointed judges can decide they know better than the EPA\" and \"The president can do whatever they want in their actions as president,\" Musk is hoping that his standing with Trump will clear the path for all of his dumbest possible bullshit.\n\nFor example, Elon would really love to relax safety standards for American automobiles. Simply, Tesla is bad at making cars. The legacy automakers have been able to dramatically close the gap on Elon's electric advantage, and consumers have responded. In order to increase productivity, Elon wants to stop worrying about every little detail of his cars abiding by the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards. He also doesn't want to work with union labor. Union labor is what built the American automobile industry.\n\nThere are other ways Musk is about to be insanely annoying. Twitter will continue circling the drain until all that's left is alt-right muck and propagandist bots running on a ChatGPT API. Starlink will continue to provide 2G speeds to warmongers around the world. xAI will autogenerate Pepe the Frog smut. SpaceX will take billions of dollars to get people to Mars and won't get halfway there.\n\nThe worst possible people will get rich. The rich will be the worst possible people.\n\nAnti-trust will probably come to a screeching halt\n\nWhile Trump and Vance have spent plenty of airtime talking about how much they want to break up big tech, I highly doubt that this will happen. Whereas the Biden administration's anti-trust efforts appear rooted in genuine consumer interest, Trump and Vance seem more interested in forcing the tech companies to further capitulate to the will of the powerful.\n\nThere is a long standing gripe on the right that these companies are engaged in some sort of targeted censorship campaign against right wing ideas. They are not. The American Right now encompasses dangerous lies and deliberate information manipulation. Google and Meta are companies with business incentives toward the truth. A Trump administration will probably threaten these companies with breakups if they don't give equal footing to the lies off of which the right profits.\n\nAs tech executives line up to obsequiously lick Trump's boots, I am pessimistic that these companies will hold the wellbeing of the American democracy over their ability to continue operating. A Trump presidency may threaten Big Tech with the kinds of lawsuits the Biden DOJ has brought forth, but I expect the Zuckerbergs of the world to capitulate at every turn.\n\nWe are super not getting a national data privacy law\n\nWhile it was unlikely under a second Democratic presidential term, it is even more unlikely under a second Trump presidency.\n\nWhat would a national data privacy law do? The big thing is it would restrict the ability of data brokers to trade on your data without your explicit consent. Remember the Cambridge Analytica scandal? In that case, data from Facebook users was being taken from users via deceptive means. That data was then bought and sold in a number of ways that were, uh, bad, including to Russian operatives. A national data privacy law would make it illegal for companies to do this.\n\nA national data privacy law would be bad for a Trump presidency in a few ways:\n\n 1. Authoritarians love the surveillance state. Under an exploitative landscape in which citizen data is constantly being sucked from our pockets and keystrokes, people can be more easily tracked, their beliefs more easily targeted, their resistance more easily thwarted. A country without a data privacy law is a country in which the government can more easily subpoena your personal information from tech companies.\n 2. AI suffers under privacy regulation. While OpenAI has already pilfered the entirety of the internet to train ChatGPT, they'd really love it they didn't have any barriers to collecting future data. Seeing as the AI industry is positioning itself as integral to US defense, innovation, and productivity, Trump won't want to push back against them.\n 3. The media industry that made Trump thrives on the exploitation of your data. Whether it's YouTube redpilling or the TikTok manosphere, the ease with which companies can take advantage of user data brings more people, especially more young people, into Trump's right wing fascistic bubble.\n 4. Russia and China really want information about Americans. Trump is pretty friendly with American adversaries. Hell, they helped him get elected both times. In the next few years Russia and China will continue to attempt to undermine American civic life. As in the Cambridge Analytica case, it's actually pretty darn easy for them to attain highly detailed data about American citizens! Without a national law that limits data companies from selling American data, this will continue.\n\nJD Vance loves cryptocurrency\n\nNow I don't want to make a blanket dismissal of cryptocurrency. I actually think that under certain circumstances and with proper regulation, cryptocurrency can be a net good for economic development around the world. What I do want to dismiss is the rampant speculation that comes with an unregulated currency. There are a number of examples of the following: Person/people make unregulated crypto coin or exchange, they market the hell out of it, evangelize about how you can get rich in this alternative market, people give unregulated crypto coin or exchange USD money, coin goes to zero, company gets to keep USD. These are broad strokes.\n\nJD Vance is one of these crypto evangelists, and the Trump administration will allow scammers to convince Americans to pour their hard earned dollars into money that is made of whispers and air.\n\nAlright here's a lightning round\n\n * The expansion of broadband internet access will slow\n   * One of the great successes of the Biden administration is the expansion of broadband internet access to underserved communities. It is unlikely a Republican adminstration will give a shit about this.\n * Russia and China will continue to exploit our infrastructure\n   * They've done it before. They will continue to do it. They will likely not face any consequences, and no efforts will be made to protect American citizens.\n * Tariffs on foreign goods will drive up prices\n   * Mentioned this last week. If Trump gets his tariffs, all types of goods imported from overseas will get more expensive for consumers.\n * The main broadcast networks will be further undermined\n   * Trump wants to use the FCC to strip the major broadcast networks of their broadcast licenses if they aren't nice to him.\n\nIn conclusion...\n\nA Trump presidency will force users of the internet (all of you) to be vigilant and thoughtful. There are countless ways in which his administration will bring hardship upon people, especially trans people, immigrants, and women. Our advocacy must extend into the streets, but with so much of our lives intertwined with the tech we carry every day we must also do what we can in ~cyberspace~.\n\nI'll leave you with a link to the Electronic Frontier Foundation, an organization I follow that advocates for the First Amendment, data privacy, and the dismantling of the surveillance capitalist system.\n\nElectronic Frontier FoundationDefending your rights in the digital worldElectronic Frontier FoundationAaron Mackey","feature_image":"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2024/11/woody-guthrie.jpg","featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","email_recipient_filter":"all","created_at":"2024-11-08T17:04:54.000Z","updated_at":"2024-11-08T17:17:53.000Z","published_at":"2024-11-08T17:12:43.000Z","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null,"newsletter_id":"66f029f981a59700086b0e28","show_title_and_feature_image":1},{"id":"67328fbf21eb6c00019b04cd","uuid":"04cbb5c4-3c78-4ed1-90bf-a710ea87da74","title":"Impressions: Yoto","slug":"impressions-yoto","mobiledoc":null,"lexical":"{\"root\":{\"children\":[{\"children\":[{\"detail\":0,\"format\":0,\"mode\":\"normal\",\"style\":\"\",\"text\":\"Two things are true this week.

Is it that it can't connect to the internet?</p><p>I would argue that rather than referring to this algorithm-less, attention respecting, limited use-case tech as \"dumb\" we should think of it as <em>more</em> thoughtful.</p><p>Arguably, our smartphones are <em>too</em> smart. They are <em>too</em> functional. Having one device on which we tell our families we love them, bear witness to genocidal horrors across the globe, listen to the Brat remix album, and take pictures, while technically impressive, does not actually make for a quality user experience. In order to make your phone work at a speed anywhere close to human processing and attention capability, you actively need to fight against how the smartphone was built. You need to aggressively scale back notifications, you need to reorganize the default home screen, and more.</p><p>Instead, it is refreshing to have a product that respects you. In order to listen to something, you need to be so intentional about it that you find a physical card and slot it into the device. Nothing happens automatically, no algorithm recommends anything, no detailed profile of your tastes is built. The Yoto Mini does not ask much more of you than the $70 it takes to purchase it. It does not hound you for location data, it does not ask to track your behavior across apps. It asks for an email and a password and (amazingly) does not sign users up for promotions or newsletters <em>by default</em>.</p><p>Our so called \"smart\" technology is smart insofar as it is able to learn everything that there is to know about the user. Their preferences, their location, their contact list, etc. As the saying goes: if you are using something for free, you are the product.</p><p>I'm certain I will seem like a grandpa when I say this, but remember the good old days? When you could buy a CD player, or a Gameboy, or a Webkinz and its functional utility lasted years? You didn't have to pretend you read the Terms and Conditions to buy a CD and play it!</p><p>It's important to point out that the Yoto is \"dumb\" explicitly because it is for children. Culturally and politically, we have correctly concluded that extracting data from elementary age children is taboo. We've agreed that children cannot consent to their personal information being taken by companies for profit.</p><p>But I often wonder why this is a luxury we afford exclusively to children. I would argue that tech companies have stretched the limits of informed consent when it comes to our data, no matter how old we are. It should not be the norm that whenever we sign up for a new account or download a new app we must agree to a legalese document that functionally zero people read.</p><p>The internet and software industries literally exist because of the large scale capability of services like Google, Spotify, Netflix, Facebook, or Instagram to take our data. I find that these companies have improved the value proposition for advertisers and data brokers while forgetting the humans on the ground. The Yoto player reminds me of a time when companies seemed genuinely interested in competing for the hearts of actual people.</p><hr><p>With all that said I just want to tack on two things I wish were different about the Yoto.</p><p>First, in the case of the Mini, it does not appear to be particularly self-repairable. Often companies will argue that in order to make their devices as durable as possible, they need to limit repairability. That's probably the case here, as the player is meant to be able to be thrown around by kids. But I still wish that it had some exposed screws or a replaceable battery. Much of my fascination with technology as a kid came from being able to take things apart and inspect how they appeared to work. I wish that was an option here.</p><p>Second, I want this for adults. The Yoto box says \"Ages 3-12+\" on it, and a glance through the available cards shows music and audiobooks for an audience spanning those ages. I want there to be more tech that encourages users to be thoughtful about how they use it. I want something that really, actually <em>turns off</em>. I want something that is frictionless, that lets me play music or podcasts without also having to open my whole phone and scroll through the pages and the apps to get what I want. Please let me buy <em>Melodrama</em> by Lorde in card form to play on this thing.</p><hr><p>In conclusion, I am obsessed with the idea of this product. If I had a kid, I would derive a lot of pleasure out of selecting music together, recording my own cards, and allowing them free and total reign over something that is just theirs. Our tech doesn't need to be \"dumb\" but it also doesn't need to be too smart. It's nice to have something that has all the luxuries of modern technology while limiting how much it wants to take from you.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-video-card kg-width-regular\" data-kg-thumbnail=\"https://arachne.ghost.io/content/media/2024/11/IMG_5597-480_thumb.jpg\" data-kg-custom-thumbnail=\"\">\n            <div class=\"kg-video-container\">\n                <video src=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/media/2024/11/IMG_5597-480.mp4\" poster=\"https://img.spacergif.org/v1/640x360/0a/spacer.png\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" playsinline=\"\" preload=\"metadata\" style=\"background: transparent url('__GHOST_URL__/content/media/2024/11/IMG_5597-480_thumb.jpg') 50% 50% / cover no-repeat;\"></video>\n                <div class=\"kg-video-overlay\">\n                    <button class=\"kg-video-large-play-icon\" aria-label=\"Play video\">\n                        <svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\">\n                            <path d=\"M23.14 10.608 2.253.164A1.559 1.559 0 0 0 0 1.557v20.887a1.558 1.558 0 0 0 2.253 1.392L23.14 13.393a1.557 1.557 0 0 0 0-2.785Z\"></path>\n                        </svg>\n                    </button>\n                </div>\n                <div class=\"kg-video-player-container\">\n                    <div class=\"kg-video-player\">\n                        <button class=\"kg-video-play-icon\" aria-label=\"Play video\">\n                            <svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\">\n                                <path d=\"M23.14 10.608 2.253.164A1.559 1.559 0 0 0 0 1.557v20.887a1.558 1.558 0 0 0 2.253 1.392L23.14 13.393a1.557 1.557 0 0 0 0-2.785Z\"></path>\n                            </svg>\n                        </button>\n                        <button class=\"kg-video-pause-icon kg-video-hide\" aria-label=\"Pause video\">\n                            <svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\">\n                                <rect x=\"3\" y=\"1\" width=\"7\" height=\"22\" rx=\"1.5\" ry=\"1.5\"></rect>\n                                <rect x=\"14\" y=\"1\" width=\"7\" height=\"22\" rx=\"1.5\" ry=\"1.5\"></rect>\n                            </svg>\n                        </button>\n                        <span class=\"kg-video-current-time\">0:00</span>\n                        <div class=\"kg-video-time\">\n                            /<span class=\"kg-video-duration\">0:05</span>\n                        </div>\n                        <input type=\"range\" class=\"kg-video-seek-slider\" max=\"100\" value=\"0\">\n                        <button class=\"kg-video-playback-rate\" aria-label=\"Adjust playback speed\">1×</button>\n                        <button class=\"kg-video-unmute-icon\" aria-label=\"Unmute\">\n                            <svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\">\n                                <path d=\"M15.189 2.021a9.728 9.728 0 0 0-7.924 4.85.249.249 0 0 1-.221.133H5.25a3 3 0 0 0-3 3v2a3 3 0 0 0 3 3h1.794a.249.249 0 0 1 .221.133 9.73 9.73 0 0 0 7.924 4.85h.06a1 1 0 0 0 1-1V3.02a1 1 0 0 0-1.06-.998Z\"></path>\n                            </svg>\n                        </button>\n                        <button class=\"kg-video-mute-icon kg-video-hide\" aria-label=\"Mute\">\n                            <svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\">\n                                <path d=\"M16.177 4.3a.248.248 0 0 0 .073-.176v-1.1a1 1 0 0 0-1.061-1 9.728 9.728 0 0 0-7.924 4.85.249.249 0 0 1-.221.133H5.25a3 3 0 0 0-3 3v2a3 3 0 0 0 3 3h.114a.251.251 0 0 0 .177-.073ZM23.707 1.706A1 1 0 0 0 22.293.292l-22 22a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.414l.009.009a1 1 0 0 0 1.405-.009l6.63-6.631A.251.251 0 0 1 8.515 17a.245.245 0 0 1 .177.075 10.081 10.081 0 0 0 6.5 2.92 1 1 0 0 0 1.061-1V9.266a.247.247 0 0 1 .073-.176Z\"></path>\n                            </svg>\n                        </button>\n                        <input type=\"range\" class=\"kg-video-volume-slider\" max=\"100\" value=\"100\">\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            \n        </figure>","comment_id":"67328fbf21eb6c00019b04cd","plaintext":"Two things are true this week. First, there isn't a ton of tech news about which I'm really excited to write. Second, I want to take a break from foretelling doom as a result of the election. So I thought this would be a great time to learn about a piece of tech and tell you some of my impressions about it.\n\nSo! For my first quasi product review I want to talk about the Yoto music player. Here are the basics:\n\nThe Yoto player is a music player for kids. I picked up the mini version, but it comes in two sizes: Yoto Player and Yoto Mini. The primary draw of the device is that it is functionally \"screenless.\" In order to select music, podcasts, or stories to listen to, the player has a large library of cards that slot into the top of the device.\n\nAlongside this primary feature, the Yoto can play kid friendly radio stations and sleep sounds. Via the accompanying app, parents can make custom cards with their own recordings that kids can insert whenever they want. It's got a rechargeable battery, Bluetooth connectivity, and WiFi.\n\nThe interface on the mini is extraordinarily basic. The two knobs you see control the whole thing, including volume, the radio, and other functions that are configurable in the app. This thing has a homework timer, this thing has a tooth brushing timer, you can accessorize with a cool case that can attach the player to a backpack.\n\nI was drawn to this device for two primary reasons. The first was the price I saw while glancing around the tech section at Target.\n\nThe Mini player I got was $70. If that seems like a lot for what essentially amounts to a Bluetooth speaker for kids, consider what you get just for the $70 (meaning without purchasing any additional cards). You get a functional speaker with multiple free radio stations and Wifi/Bluetooth connectivity. You get an extremely quick and easy to use mobile app for configuring the device. You get a safe and privacy focused way to open kids up to music and storytelling. There is no subscription. There is no subscription. For $70 you get a speaker that simply works and an app that simply works. The larger version is not as portable and is $100, but I still contend that this is an extraordinarily well priced piece of hardware/software.\n\nAcross consumer industries, companies are delivering lower quality products for higher quality prices. It is so refreshing to see a player come into the tech space for a reasonable cost for what it offers.\n\nThe other reason I was drawn to this product is that I have a fascination (mild obsession) with NFC cards. NFC, or near field communication, is the technology that allows things like tap to pay to work. If you've ever purchased an Amiibo, one of those Nintendo figurines that unlocks special in-game treats, those also work on NFC. I have an NFC card attached to the door frame of the closet in which we have our laundry machines. Since the machines don't have their own timers, I have the card set up so that when I hold my phone to it I can select whether I'm running the washer or the drier and set a timer for it.\n\nI have a vision of a sort of \"music wall,\" something akin to the vinyl album displays music lovers will occasionally display along their walls. What I'd really love is to have a wall with all of my favorite albums where I can walk up to the wall, hold my phone to an album, and it automatically begins playing on my Homepods. I envision this use case as kind of like \"putting a record on,\" but with this intriguing interplay between physical space and digital space.\n\nThe Yoto (kind of) allows for a similar functionality. If you own the music files of an album you love, you can create your own card, put it in the player, and listen. I think that is so cool.\n\nThe Yoto player is another entry into a product category that could, somewhat pejoratively, be called \"dumb tech.\"\n\nWhat makes something dumb, though? Is it simply that is doesn't have a glitzy, candy colored screen to suck attention toward? Is it that it doesn't have a fancy camera? Is it that it can't connect to the internet?\n\nI would argue that rather than referring to this algorithm-less, attention respecting, limited use-case tech as \"dumb\" we should think of it as more thoughtful.\n\nArguably, our smartphones are too smart. They are too functional. Having one device on which we tell our families we love them, bear witness to genocidal horrors across the globe, listen to the Brat remix album, and take pictures, while technically impressive, does not actually make for a quality user experience. In order to make your phone work at a speed anywhere close to human processing and attention capability, you actively need to fight against how the smartphone was built. You need to aggressively scale back notifications, you need to reorganize the default home screen, and more.\n\nInstead, it is refreshing to have a product that respects you. In order to listen to something, you need to be so intentional about it that you find a physical card and slot it into the device. Nothing happens automatically, no algorithm recommends anything, no detailed profile of your tastes is built. The Yoto Mini does not ask much more of you than the $70 it takes to purchase it. It does not hound you for location data, it does not ask to track your behavior across apps. It asks for an email and a password and (amazingly) does not sign users up for promotions or newsletters by default.\n\nOur so called \"smart\" technology is smart insofar as it is able to learn everything that there is to know about the user. Their preferences, their location, their contact list, etc. As the saying goes: if you are using something for free, you are the product.\n\nI'm certain I will seem like a grandpa when I say this, but remember the good old days? When you could buy a CD player, or a Gameboy, or a Webkinz and its functional utility lasted years? You didn't have to pretend you read the Terms and Conditions to buy a CD and play it!\n\nIt's important to point out that the Yoto is \"dumb\" explicitly because it is for children.

I find that these companies have improved the value proposition for advertisers and data brokers while forgetting the humans on the ground. The Yoto player reminds me of a time when companies seemed genuinely interested in competing for the hearts of actual people.\n\nWith all that said I just want to tack on two things I wish were different about the Yoto.\n\nFirst, in the case of the Mini, it does not appear to be particularly self-repairable.

Education in media literacy has not matched the pace of media proliferation, resulting in problems ranging from the trivial to the democracy undermining. We do not have a really functional information economy. Not because the work of skilled, well-resourced journalists and researchers has gotten worse, but because the work of unskilled and alternatively motivated contributors has gotten better.</p><p>What do I mean by this? If we go back a couple decades, even just to the late 90s and 2000s, there was a clear delineation between Real And Serious Journalism and Everything Else. It was most evident in the medium by which people received their news. If it was on TV on the nightly news or in the newspaper the next morning, audiences could trust that what they were being told had a supporting structure of credibility. While there are certainly reasons this was not entirely true, radio, television, and newspaper syndicates spent decades earning the trust of audiences through rigorous, professionalized work. Since the halls of media power are as self-congratulatory as they are self-important, we've even gotten multiple Oscar winning movies about the thankless work of professionals who exposed the cover-up of decades of child abuse in Boston (<em>Spotlight</em>) or got to the bottom of the Watergate scandal (<em>All The President's Men</em>).</p><p>When these main avenues for information were dominant - radio, television, newspaper/magazine - it was easier to differentiate legitimate from illegitimate information. If you came across a flyer that told you lizard people had infiltrated the federal government, if you saw a tabloid magazine cover that told you the Yankees won their exhibition game against the Martians, if you clicked through a shoddy homemade HTML site that told you the fluoride in your water was chemically castrating you, the mere fact that it wasn't in the more trusted venues for information may make you an inch more skeptical of what you were reading.</p><p>But, obviously, the internet has completely overturned this hierarchy. I want to clarify upfront that I say this not as a judgement or as a statement in support that one system of spreading information is better or worse than the other, merely to point out this fact. <em>Everything</em> is online now. On TikTok, for example, you may view one video from the well-resourced and salaried workers at The Washington Post explaining a current event and the very next video could be a person you've never seen before explaining the same current event. There is no differentiation, and the human brain is not constructing a serious line between the first video and the second video.</p><p>It's extremely important for me to point out that I am not necessarily saying that the work of legacy media companies is inherently better than the work of your favorite independent internet personality. It is abundantly clear, and certainly has been in the last year and change, that the legacy media institutions will often prioritize the perspectives of those in power over the marginalized and oppressed.</p><p>I say all of this to elucidate what I think is a largely ignored facet of our chaotic media ecosystem. To me, it is not particularly important whether or not there is more or less ridiculous bullshit finding its way through the manifold channels of the internet to peoples' eyeballs and ears. It is more important that the incentive structure of the media industries is completely, utterly, entirely fucked.</p><hr><h4 id=\"influencers-are-not-journalists\">Influencers are not journalists</h4><p>Bad faith contributors to the information economy have gotten much better. Their websites look just like the websites of more legitimate outlets, their podcast setups look just like Larry King, their digital assets, their video editing, their relationship with powerful people...</p><p>It is all a construction to give the message a sense of legitimacy, rigor, and independence that signals to audiences \"You can trust this.\" Consider Alex Jones and InfoWars. If a red and veiny man was screaming at you from his basement on a 480p resolution stream, you might question that guy's motivations, you might make assumptions about what his life is like beyond the spittle and roid rage. But put that guy in a shiny studio that looks like CNN, give him a blazer, get someone to touch up his makeup between takes, and suddenly you have all of the airs of credibility. Suddenly, claiming that the children killed at Sandy Hook were actors has the same polish as Anderson Cooper.</p><p>Suddenly, advertisers of snake oil supplements and tummy trainers look upon that stream as a viable place to capture customers. Suddenly that money is funding a growing alt-right media empire. And the snowball picks up dollars and audience and rolls and rolls down the hill.</p><p>But Alex Jones is not a journalist. He is not even a truth seeker. Alex Jones is an opportunistic loud mouth that used his skills, a broken incentive structure that privileges views and engagement, and the internet to become influential.</p><p>Jones is obviously an extreme example, but there are countless individuals online across all verticals - tech, product reviews, sports, etc. - that use basically the same playbook in order to win audience attention, convert that into advertiser dollars, and become prioritized sources of information for the population.</p><p>The influencer economy privileges influence, not integrity.

Education in media literacy has not matched the pace of media proliferation, resulting in problems ranging from the trivial to the democracy undermining. We do not have a really functional information economy. Not because the work of skilled, well-resourced journalists and researchers has gotten worse, but because the work of unskilled and alternatively motivated contributors has gotten better.\n\nWhat do I mean by this? If we go back a couple decades, even just to the late 90s and 2000s, there was a clear delineation between Real And Serious Journalism and Everything Else. It was most evident in the medium by which people received their news. If it was on TV on the nightly news or in the newspaper the next morning, audiences could trust that what they were being told had a supporting structure of credibility. While there are certainly reasons this was not entirely true, radio, television, and newspaper syndicates spent decades earning the trust of audiences through rigorous, professionalized work. Since the halls of media power are as self-congratulatory as they are self-important, we've even gotten multiple Oscar winning movies about the thankless work of professionals who exposed the cover-up of decades of child abuse in Boston (Spotlight) or got to the bottom of the Watergate scandal (All The President's Men).\n\nWhen these main avenues for information were dominant - radio, television, newspaper/magazine - it was easier to differentiate legitimate from illegitimate information. If you came across a flyer that told you lizard people had infiltrated the federal government, if you saw a tabloid magazine cover that told you the Yankees won their exhibition game against the Martians, if you clicked through a shoddy homemade HTML site that told you the fluoride in your water was chemically castrating you, the mere fact that it wasn't in the more trusted venues for information may make you an inch more skeptical of what you were reading.\n\nBut, obviously, the internet has completely overturned this hierarchy. I want to clarify upfront that I say this not as a judgement or as a statement in support that one system of spreading information is better or worse than the other, merely to point out this fact. Everything is online now. On TikTok, for example, you may view one video from the well-resourced and salaried workers at The Washington Post explaining a current event and the very next video could be a person you've never seen before explaining the same current event. There is no differentiation, and the human brain is not constructing a serious line between the first video and the second video.\n\nIt's extremely important for me to point out that I am not necessarily saying that the work of legacy media companies is inherently better than the work of your favorite independent internet personality. It is abundantly clear, and certainly has been in the last year and change, that the legacy media institutions will often prioritize the perspectives of those in power over the marginalized and oppressed.\n\nI say all of this to elucidate what I think is a largely ignored facet of our chaotic media ecosystem. To me, it is not particularly important whether or not there is more or less ridiculous bullshit finding its way through the manifold channels of the internet to peoples' eyeballs and ears. It is more important that the incentive structure of the media industries is completely, utterly, entirely fucked.\n\nInfluencers are not journalists\n\nBad faith contributors to the information economy have gotten much better. Their websites look just like the websites of more legitimate outlets, their podcast setups look just like Larry King, their digital assets, their video editing, their relationship with powerful people...\n\nIt is all a construction to give the message a sense of legitimacy, rigor, and independence that signals to audiences \"You can trust this.\" Consider Alex Jones and InfoWars. If a red and veiny man was screaming at you from his basement on a 480p resolution stream, you might question that guy's motivations, you might make assumptions about what his life is like beyond the spittle and roid rage. But put that guy in a shiny studio that looks like CNN, give him a blazer, get someone to touch up his makeup between takes, and suddenly you have all of the airs of credibility. Suddenly, claiming that the children killed at Sandy Hook were actors has the same polish as Anderson Cooper.\n\nSuddenly, advertisers of snake oil supplements and tummy trainers look upon that stream as a viable place to capture customers. Suddenly that money is funding a growing alt-right media empire. And the snowball picks up dollars and audience and rolls and rolls down the hill.\n\nBut Alex Jones is not a journalist. He is not even a truth seeker. Alex Jones is an opportunistic loud mouth that used his skills, a broken incentive structure that privileges views and engagement, and the internet to become influential.\n\nJones is obviously an extreme example, but there are countless individuals online across all verticals - tech, product reviews, sports, etc. - that use basically the same playbook in order to win audience attention, convert that into advertiser dollars, and become prioritized sources of information for the population.\n\nThe influencer economy privileges influence, not integrity. You win influence by winning engagement. You win engagement by saying outlandish things, doing ridiculous stunts, and cozying up to whoever you can put in your thumbnail to get people to click.\n\nPundits are not journalists\n\nI stopped watching cable TV news a long time ago. I cringe and recoil at the vision of four heads in rectangles, a chyron that reads \"MAYBE BIRTHERISM MADE A FEW GOOD POINTS,\" and any program called like \"Hardhitters,\" \"Do Not Pass Joe,\" or \"Friendly Fire.\" The thing I find most intolerable, though, is the utilization of so-called \"experts\" to \"debate\" whatever the topic of that three and a half minutes is before the pharmaceutical commercials play.\n\nWe call these people pundits. They are brought on television as authoritative voices on some kind of issue, allowed to say the dumbest shit possible, and run it all back the next day when some other non-controversy makes its way to the producer's desk.\n\nOften, though, this authority is not earned. It is simply awarded to whatever guileless stooge is most willing to inherit the talking points of whatever sports team or political party they are there to stump for. Under the lights, in the suits, these people are allowed a credibility that ought to be questioned.\n\nTake, for example, the recent fracas caused by loser Ryan Girdusky, who made the incredibly racist \"beeper\" comment to Mehdi Hasan in a CNN roundtable just before the election. Every possible piece of evidence a booker on a television news program would need to know that Gidursky is a hack, is not interested in good faith discourse, and was only showing his face to garner favor with the Republican elites was easily findable. You can go to his own website to see the multiple television appearances he's made in which he just opens the spigot on the kind of nonsense that engages viewers that agree with him and enrages viewers that don't.\n\nIt's not just on television though. On the major social media platforms people assert their expertise in countless unchecked ways. It happens when the person speaking says something like \"Do you have neck pain? Hi, I'm a doctor that specializes in spinal injuries\" without disclosing to you that they are actually a chiropractor, not an MD. It happens when Joe Rogan invites some self assured dickhead on his podcast to talk about how your wireless Xbox controller is giving you ball cancer.\n\nAt the end of the day, pundits are not legitimate contributors to public discourse. Their influence and authority is granted not by the credibility of their work, but by the stakeholders that are made more powerful and companies made more rich.\n\nI am not a journalist\n\nDespite my best efforts to write quality newsletters that are well researched, I am not a journalist. I do not have an educational background in journalism. I do not have a formalized code of ethics that I follow or an institutional style guide. Considering I don't currently have a job I imagine I would be pretty easy to buy if some advertiser came my way. But there are other ways I hope to engender your trust. For most of you that trust comes from the fact that you literally know me lol and knew me before I ever started writing Arachne.\n\nBut this offers me a great moment to stop and offer you some media literacy tips. Here are some questions I hope you will think about when engaging with information online:\n\n * Who wrote this?\n * How is this funded? Ads? Subscriptions? Non-profit? Corporate sponsorship?\n * Who benefits if what I see here is true?\n * Who benefits if what I see here is half-true?\n * Who benefits if what I see here is false?\n * Have I heard of this writer/creator/influencer or outlet before?\n * Does this information have a source?\n * How does this information fit into my understanding of how the world works?\n * Do I have a model for understanding how the world works?\n * Is the information affirmed by common assumptions?\n\nYou can deploy questions like this for so much that you see. You can do it for Arachne. You can do it for Pop Base tweets, you can do it for sports, for politics, for anything you see. It is important as a practice to constantly be thinking about yourself as someone who can be influenced. Once you consider that you can be influenced, it is important then to unravel the countless ways different stakeholders are vying for your attention. I promise you they are thinking more about how to get you than you are thinking about how not to get got.\n\nAmericans’ Trust in Media Remains at Trend LowAmericans’ confidence in the media is at its lowest point, as Democrats’ confidence is near the record low and Republicans’ is almost nonexistent.GallupMegan Brenan\n\nA much proliferated doomer topic of the media elite is this idea that trust in legacy American media is at an all time low.

Would love to hear any hot takes you might have going into next year, tech and not tech related!</p>","comment_id":"675b1402239e1000015026fa","plaintext":"For me and many of my friends, 2024 has been an absolute doozy. Just an absolute disaster of a year. Without belaboring it, I'll just say that 2025 cannot come fast enough. As the clock ticks down on this mudpit of a year, let's take an opportunity to envision what next year might have in store for us. Here are my 2025 tech hot takes, covering four verticals (AI, Entertainment, Social Media, and Hardware) and three flavor profiles (mild, medium, hot). Some are validated with evidence, and some are just vibes! First, let's do mild.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMild Tech Takes 🌶️\n\n\nNot too spicy\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAI - Apple Intelligence will be the predominant consumer AI product\n\nI guess I should define what I mean by \"consumer AI product.\" These are the various chatbots, photo editors, and text generators that you see asking you for $20 a month. ChatGPT, Claude, Google's Gemini, these are sort of what I mean. My mild take is that a critical mass of peoples' first and most consistent interactions with generative AI will happen inside iOS, iPadOS, and macOS, and the idea of AI as most forwardly a chatbot will begin to fade away.\n\nI'm of the belief that LLMs are like tap water. Many companies are trying to sell it in a bottle, but at the end of the day it has more use coming from the faucets.\n\n\nEntertainment - The Fantastic Four flops and fails\n\nDisney/Marvel is betting big on next year's Fantastic Four reboot.\n\nMarvel Will Release No More Than Three Movies and Two Shows Per Year, Bob Iger SaysDisney CEO Bob Iger says the company is shrinking the MCU with a new mission to drop the number of Marvel TV series to two a year and the film output to no more than three.VarietyJennifer Maas\n\nIn the post \"Endgame\" era, MCU movies have had a serious drop off in their appeal. Critics hate them, audiences shrug them off, and the experiments (looking at you Multiverse of Madness) are just not working out. Fantastic Four will take place in a \"retro-futurist world\" and will star some serious talent. It's already been announced that the Four will appear in whatever Dr. Doom movies RDJ is gunna be in. This feels like their shot to start something new and let the OG MCU fade away as a sort of separate super timeline.\n\nI just don't know if this is going to work. My suspicion says no.\n\n\nSocial Media - I'm so sorry, but I think NFTs are going to have another moment\n\nI don't know why. I just feel like with Trump becoming president and Elon getting louder than ever, there's bound to be some skullduggery. NFTs are peak skullduggery.\n\n\nHardware - The iPhone breaks its cycle\n\nFor ten years, new iPhones debuted each fall, usually in September and October. But there are two narratives I'm following that might suggest Apple will push back the iPhone 17.\n\nApple reportedly postponing a ‘larger-than-usual’ number of upcoming iOS 19 features - 9to5MacAccording to Mark Gurman from Bloomberg, Apple has reportedly postponed a high number of iOS 19 features for a later…9to5MacMichael BurkhardtApple iPhone 17 ‘Air’ Thinnest-Ever Design Emerges In New LeakApple will have an all-new iPhone with radically different design, it’s thought. And a new element of what it will look like has been leaked.ForbesDavid Phelan\n\nI just have a hunch. This is complete speculation. But I have a feeling they drop this rumored iPhone \"Air\" in the typical fall slot and then wait until 2026 (when more of their software is ready) to release a new lineup of true successors. This year, Apple did something unusual and released their new iPhone before their new software was ready. Obviously they can do that again, but I have a feeling the \"big differences\" between the 16 and 17 will only be most obvious with the software.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMedium Tech Takes 🌶️🌶️\n\n\nMaybe keep some water nearby\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAI - Somebody, somewhere does something very bad with an open source LLM\n\nI think 2025 is the year AI fantasy comes down to reality. Not to alarm you, but Meta and other companies have released AI models that can be run locally without oversight. Generally, I think open source software is a net positive, but I am making a prediction that these extremely powerful tools do not have effective enough guardrails to prevent against individual and organized bad actors.\n\nWhat could this mean? I worry about cyber attacks to infrastructure and novel biochemical weapons, primarily. 2025 feels like the year we have to contend with some of the bad these models can bring.\n\n\nEntertainment - Somebody, somewhere finally lets us make streaming playlists and custom channels\n\nThis is such an unbelievable layup to me I am suprised that it has not happened yet. Maybe this is more of a wish than a prediction, but I just want to be able to make playlists and channels of shows and episodes how people do in Apple Music and Spotify. I think there is too much choice involved in watching television now, and creating a way for users to curate hours of watch time instead of little chunks or accidental binges feels like something these companies should do.\n\nFor what it's worth, there may be legal and advertising reasons the streamers don't want to do this. There may be fine print on their contracts with the unions for what is allowed with streaming, and advertisers might not love not having as much control over where their ads display. But who gives a shit, this would be a killer feature.\n\n\nSocial Media - TikTok gets sold to Amazon, Walmart, or Target\n\nTikTok failed to save itself with the First AmendmentNational security overrides the First Amendment in court.The Verge\n\nTikTok is having a rough week. After failing to stave off government efforts to force a sale of the company or cease operations, they are left with few options. I have written before about how silly, hypocritical, and ineffective this whole TikTok fracas has been, but now that we are here, what's going to happen?\n\nI believe it's possible TikTok sells and one of the retail giants is the buyer. TikTok is increasingly a platform for advertising and selling goods, a sort of vertically oriented QVC. I personally think that TikTok should pivot more in the direction of YouTube, where creators have been making livings off of their work for over a decade now. But hey if they want to algorithmically deprioritize the creators that made the app what it is in the first place be my guest.\n\n\nHardware - Mergers and acquisitions in the health/fitness space\n\nThe pandemic was huge for fitness startups, especially the ones that made it easier to work out at home. But since people have returned to a half normal life, lots of companies are sitting on inventory and dwindling capital. Peloton, for example, has scaled back hardware development in favor of software and digital experiences.\n\nThere is a wide landscape of companies in this space, and they are all tailing Samsung - who recently got involved with their own smart ring health tracker - and Apple. With subscription fatigue and limited hardware lock-in for companies like Oura, Whoop, and Garmin, I see companies getting together to pool resources and offer more comprehensive services to people.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHot Tech Takes 🌶️🌶️🌶️\n\n\n2,000,000 on the Scoville scale. Almost.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAI - An AI federal agency is founded\n\nIn March of 2023, Sam Altman spoke in front of Congress on a sort of PR march to engender favor with the old guys in Washington.

To get to 100 million in a year would be an astonishing feat and is very unlikely, but here's how I think they do it.\n\n 1. Elon Musk does another insane thing over at Twitter that causes a flood over to Bluesky comparable to the post election one.\n 2. Bluesky builds on its audience in Brazil. X is back up in Brazil, but for the brief time that it was shut down, users immediately went to Bluesky. A lot more people would have to do this but there are a lot of people.\n 3. Outlets and entertainment companies focus more energy reaching audiences on Bluesky.\n\n\nHardware - The \"metaverse\" shuts down\n\nWhen Facebook changed its name to Meta, it signaled a company wide shift toward VR hardware and experiences.

The social media profit incentive doesn't generate the type of feedback loop that it does for these people.\n\nIf you are reading this and nodding along you can skip to the horizontal divider below, but if not I ask you to imagine you are sitting across from me at a table and I am saying these things directly to you and as kindly and thoughtfully as is possible.\n\nThere is no radical American left wing equivalent to the organized and well resourced far right.\n\nAnd in cases where there even might be, they do not have the funding or scale of the organizations and individuals listed above. There are no left wing anti-fascist militias who receive tips and training from current duty American police officers, as is the case with the armed militias. To the extent that the organizations above do, MSNBC or another supposedly left leaning media outlet do not coordinate with elected and public officials in the Democratic Party in order to further \"extreme\" leftist views like universal healthcare, improvements to social security, or, uh, civil rights. The existing, limited roster of self described leftist online influencers are not funded directly by ideological institutions with powerful megadonors such as Turning Point USA, PragerU, The Heritage Foundation, or The Federalist Society.\n\nAnd where these left wing organizations do exist, they often divert their focus from marketing their ideas toward actually attempting to get things done. Lets leave alone the federal Democratic Party for a moment in this discussion and think more about things like The Innocence Project, which seeks to provide legal aid to the wrongfully convicted. Or the ACLU, or Lambda Legal. Where they might spend their time lobbying and chattering in the ears of Democratic politicians, they do not hold the sway for the left that organizations like The Federalist Society, who hand picked Neil Gorsuch for Donald Trump, have for the right.\n\nNow, there are a couple things complicating the neatness of such a bold statement as titles this section. For one, there are people who consider themselves leftists who do and say things that come across as \"extreme.\" But lets take a leftist utopian idea, a borderless planet, for example. An extremist means of arriving at this world may involve violence against heads of state, or localized demonstrations at border control facilities. But I ask you to genuinely consider just how mind bogglingly distant we actually are from this topic coming up in typical legislative debate, how probably never in your life have you seen this topic discussed on the six o'clock news, and what the public reaction today would be to a couple people bombing a border patrol site in Maine. The most, most extreme views for a more egalitarian, sustainable world have nowhere near the cultural capital or legislative power that mass deportation, strict gender traditionalism, or capitalist deregulation have.\n\nAnother complicating aspect of this is the national Democratic Party. Frankly, the Dems are feckless, whiny losers who continue to bring a foam Minecraft pick axe to the Javelin missile fight. They aren't just bad at fighting, the don't even know the fight they are in. They think the country is in a fight for politics that works, tangible improvements to peoples' lives, and popular ideas winning out. It has been true for decades (but never more true than the last Trump decade) that the fight is in messaging, propaganda, and providing a sense of purpose for your voters. You cannot move people when you don't even talk about your successes and accept every failure on its face. You cannot move people when you complain about the Supreme Court or the filibuster and then, when fully capable of reforming them, do nothing. There are a few reasons the ostensibly \"left\" party in the US does not bow to radical ideas, but the end result is that standing for bodily autonomy, affordable education, and freedom of expression get maligned as extreme by the other party. So all in all, a reason there is not a thriving left wing propaganda machine like there is on the right is that the Democrats don't seem all that interested in making one happen.\n\nJust to say: I am not a professional journalist or political analyst. I am writing in broad strokes and from a somewhat emotionally driven place today. Anyway.\n\nAll of the above background tells you a lot about the current state of social media, and the flywheel it creates for our basest, most problematic ideas. Simply, propaganda rates. Anger sells. It draws the eyes, and the eyes draw the advertisers. And if the advertisers are less interested in the sort of \"progressive\" ideas that have pink washed America's Boards of Directors, then why worry what content \"The McRib is Back\" shows up next to? Currently, the right wing has a monopoly on propaganda.\n\nWhich leaves us with a series of nigh unanswerable questions about what we are to do about all of this. The answer, on a macro level, generally lies in labor and community organizing. But what are you, an individual person, supposed to do? Should you keep using these sites even though they abet the worst people? If the outside world increasingly pulls people apart, and a happy, vestigial part of these sites is that they bring people together, how can you cut them out of your life?\n\n\nI like using Facebook and Instagram\n\nAs much as the company that operates these sites angers me, there are things I like about using these platforms.\n\nIn the case of Facebook, I enjoy having an online archive of things I did and said as an adolescent. I no longer post images or thoughts to Facebook, but I still go on to see what's up. I enjoy sending ridiculous screenshots of posts in my hometown \"Mommies\" group to my friends. I like perusing Facebook Marketplace. I like having sports news aggregated for me on my feed.\n\nIn the case of Instagram, I mostly enjoy tapping through stories my friends post. I enjoy keeping tabs on what people in my community are talking about and how they feel about it. I like having a space to curate an image. I like being able to support the work my friends do.\n\nAnd if you use these sites, or Whatsapp, I'm willing to bet that you can identify actual, pro-social things you enjoy about using them.\n\nWe arrive at a problem of scale, though. When Zuck said a few months ago that creators and publishers \"overestimate\" the value they have for training AI, he was not kidding and he is correct. This also means that no individual user, especially not one without a lot of followers or serious engagement means that much to the bottom line of the site. Thus, leaving these platforms in protest might actually hurt you more than it hurts them.\n\nTo get a critical mass of people, even just the 100 or so people closest to you, onto a new place with all the stuff you like and without all the baggage is basically a non-starter.\n\nSo what are we even supposed to do? If we individually leave the platforms, we risk losing connective tissue with people we actually care about while not making a broader difference to the bottom line of the company. If we go somewhere else like Bluesky the features are not currently as robust for keeping up with people on your social graph. Say we concede that we need to do better in our offline lives to find community and engage with loved ones, and that \"should\" replace what we have on Facebook, Instagram, and Whatsapp. Sure! Not many would disagree with this. But that doesn't happen overnight, and is not always within the realm of possibility economically or geographically.\n\nThese platforms provided an excellent place for people of all stripes to find community, gain a sense of self, and be entertained. But at the same time, they have cannibalized the trust and goodwill that brings people to such places to begin with.\n\nSo here's what I am planning to do, and maybe it'll prompt some ideas in your mind about how to approach your use of Meta products and social media in general.\n\nI am going to:\n\n * write newsletters informing people in my community about companies who do bad things. Check!\n * download a copy of all of my data on Facebook and Instagram. This can be easily done on both platforms, here and here. If I choose to deactivate those accounts, I can rest assured that I have a copy.\n * research alternative ways of connecting with a broader network that are more bottom up (i.e. group texts and shared photo albums).\n * support platforms actively disrupting the advertiser-led business model of social media. Bluesky and Letterboxd are two examples of this.\n * engage offline with community spaces and organizations.\n * support independent, creator-owned, subscriber-supported media and entertainment outlets.\n\nIn making these things a daily practice, I hope to reduce my reliance on these platforms.\n\nThat's all I've got for today. I wish I had a more pleasing way to tie this all together. I desperately want to lay out one grand unifying theory of how we serve the social media companies and they don't serve us. But for now I just have this. Let me know what you think and feel free to share this with friends. If nothing else, I hope you seek out more information on these topics, and I hope to see you making our online world a better place alongside me.","feature_image":"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1493836692373-ad82dc8644c3?crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&fit=max&fm=jpg&ixid=M3wxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDJ8fHBob25lc3xlbnwwfHx8fDE3MzY1NTA3NjV8MA&ixlib=rb-4.0.3&q=80&w=2000","featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","email_recipient_filter":"all","created_at":"2025-01-10T23:11:29.000Z","updated_at":"2025-01-10T23:14:29.000Z","published_at":"2025-01-09T23:13:00.000Z","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null,"newsletter_id":"66f029f981a59700086b0e28","show_title_and_feature_image":1},{"id":"678693e6c4738e000189c874","uuid":"cf645d82-30df-4fda-8fdd-b196cb2f5fe4","title":"Defining \"AGI\"","slug":"defining-agi","mobiledoc":null,"lexical":"{\"root\":{\"children\":[{\"children\":[{\"detail\":0,\"format\":0,\"mode\":\"normal\",\"style\":\"\",\"text\":\"Hello again everyone.

What will our 21st century version of this look like?</p>","comment_id":"678693e6c4738e000189c874","plaintext":"Hello again everyone. It's a bright new week, which means it's time for some more Arachne. This week, I want to provide some context and some working definitions around artificial general intelligence, or \"AGI.\" What it is, what it isn't, and why getting to define the term is so important.\n\n\nSo what is it?\n\nAGI is understood to mean a system of artificial intelligence that matches and/or surpasses the capabilities of humans. It is the ultimate goal of OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, and they describe it in their charter as \"highly autonomous systems that outperform humans at most economically valuable work.\"\n\nWhile you may be impressed with modern consumer LLMs like Claude, Gemini, and ChatGPT, these existing models are not particularly close to the accepted industry definition of AGI. They are not autonomous, they lack true understanding and true learning, and they are restricted in a number of ways. This is broad strokes-y, but these systems are basically very fancy word generators built on an extremely large set of parameters. If you ask one of these chatbots what the capital of France is, they do not know in the way that human brains know this. They are deriving an answer from an intricately trained set of linguistic probabilities to arrive at the highest probable answer. This is why these systems and AI image generators are not particularly good at novel problems. They were not trained on every novel problem a person could have.\n\nAGI is the next step above this, the one where the system can approach novel problems (ones not in its enormous training data) and solve them as a person might. Whereas current AI is used to listen in on work meetings and provide summaries and meaningful insights after the fact, an AGI would be an additional contributor to the conversation, one that is making decisions, has opinions, and can execute on them.\n\n\nThat sounds horrifying\n\nYeah, I mean, I don't love it philosophically. The basic idea is not just \"what if we had a computer human?\" but also \"what if we had an entity equal to or greater than the combined intelligence and problem solving capability of the world's smartest humans?\"\n\nHow could we ensure it wouldn't \"go rogue\"? What about the biases in its training data? We could go on forever with questions.\n\nAGI and the broader field of so-called \"agentic\" AI has a pretty explicit purpose. These companies want to create a system that can replace human labor, thus the part in the OpenAI charter about \"economically valuable\" work. Consider for a moment the cynicism of this. OpenAI believes it can build a highly advanced, autonomous super-intelligence, and in the first ten words of their definition they specifically call out \"economically valuable work.\" Not work that can promote greater human unity against climate change, or aid in resolving violent conflict, or curing Alzheimers, and so on.\n\nIt's important that I say that OpenAI thinks an AGI could do these things, but their framing of the definition suggests that AGI would go after these goals because of the ways in which they are economically valuable.\n\nThere are a million reasons people are born and live, there are infinite ways the human intelligence can be deployed, and I would argue that very, very few of them are because humans are \"economically valuable.\" We are not created to make dollars, we are not loved for our productivity, our genius is not represented by the bottom line. Our genius is for the ways we improve the lives of people around us and promise the world for those who have yet to arrive. Economics can help us solve problems, it is not the problem we need to solve.\n\n\nBut there is something else going on\n\nSince 2019, OpenAI has received funding, computing support, and other resources from Microsoft. This partnership yielded incredible results for OpenAI. They were able to release ChatGPT in December of 2022 and basically overnight became a household name, not to mention the billions and billions of dollars they have been given in funding, from Microsoft and others. OpenAI likely could not have become what it is today without the support of Microsoft's Azure computing platform, which went out of its way to prioritize the data crunching that training advanced LLMs requires.\n\nNow, though, there is increasing tension between the two companies. Last fall, The New York Times reported on breakdowns in the personal and professional relationship of the two companies. On Microsoft's side, they want to see some financial return on their investment. On OpenAI's side, they feel they aren't getting enough support to achieve AGI.\n\nBut there's a fun little wrinkle. In the terms of Microsoft and OpenAI's partnership agreement, OpenAI has an out if they achieve AGI. But the definition of what this means is not abundantly clear in their agreement, and over the last few months Sam Altman has gone on tour to move the goalposts on what AGI really is.\n\nSam Altman lowers the bar for AGIOpenAI used to say that artificial general intelligence would change everything. Not anymore.The Verge\n\nSimply, he's doing this because he wants out of that Microsoft deal, he wants to be the first to AGI, and he thinks doing so would make his company piles and piles of money as other companies begin to \"hire\" his computer intelligence.\n\n\nSo where does this leave us?\n\nWell, for one, I would take any assertion that someone had achieved AGI with a massive grain of salt. There are incentives beyond \"this would be sick, bro\" that might prompt Altman to say he's got AGI when what he's got is just a really good AI. Namely, the deal he's trying to get out of, but also the pitch he's making to other companies that they could, uh, stop hiring pesky humans and start employing his economically valuable machine.\n\nFor two, even if OpenAI does get to something that can be reasonably declared to be AGI, our biggest problem will not be the AGI, but the downstream effects of replacing/supplementing that much human labor. During the Industrial Revolution, while more manual tasks were automated and government worker safety and welfare programs were essentially nonexistent, work became extraordinarily cheap. Your factory worker mangled her arm in the machinery of your textile loom? Well there's a woman waiting right outside for the honor of the pennies she'll get to clean the blood and take that seat. In a world with true AGI, it is desk jobs and so-called \"knowledge\" work that will be replaced. In the United States, this class of people relies on their jobs for retirement funding and healthcare benefits. In turn, our federal government relies on these workers for the 89% of federal tax revenue that comes from income tax and Social Security/Medicare taxes.\n\nWhat happens when these workers lose their jobs en masse? Those people who once got basic needs covered by private industry will now need to turn to the government for support. But if the government loses tax revenue for the programs it uses to support these people, how will it pay for a rising tide of people who once contributed to funds, but now needs the government to \"pay\" them? The greatest negative effect on humans from AGI is not a science fiction fantasy of enslavement, it is an exacerbation of our existing inequities and our profound mismanagement of global wealth.\n\nFollowing the Industrial Revolution, a series of dramatic reforms were made to protect human workers. OSHA was formed as the Bureau of Labor Standards in 1934. The National Labor Relations Act (the Wagner Act) was signed by FDR in 1935, federally enshrining workers' rights to organize. And of course there was the creation of Social Security and Medicare as part of the New Deal.

I cannot and will not sit here and judge how anyone else chooses to use their devices or their internet. But, for me? It was time to go.\n\n\nWe are experiencing \"a moment\"\n\nThis upcoming week has profound implications for the landscape of social media in this country. To name a few:\n\n * Donald Trump will be inaugurated again. At the end of his last term, he was banned from multiple notable platforms. This time around, he is assuming the presidency with all of the big companies falling in line behind him. Literally. Multiple social media and technology CEOs will be in attendance on Monday.\n * The owner of Twitter will have the ear of the president and the dollars to remain relevant.\n * TikTok is heading for a complete shut down on Sunday, leaving close to 200 million users in the lurch.\n\nIt's hard to think of another moment with as much stuff going on in the world of social media. There is a true feeling, to me, that we are at something of an inflection point. Behind us is 20 years of figuring out what social media is, around us is the final crystallization of where the arrows always pointed, and ahead of us is an unsteady, but somewhat promising new world. It is because of the promise of that new world that I deleted my Facebook and Instagram accounts.\n\n\nThe main drawbacks\n\nThe decision did not come easy, and even now I question if I made the right choice. I found myself wondering, for example, what it would cost to other people for me to leave. I had dozens and dozens of uploaded pictures with tags and comments that now just...disappear. (I have them all in a big trove of downloaded data, but only I can see that.) I had exchanges on my page between friends, jokes passed, memes created.\n\nAnother drawback is that there are still people who I correspond with somewhat regularly there. We'll have to take those conversations somewhere else.\n\nIf I meet someone and want to find out more about them, or want to investigate certain connections I have, I can no longer do this. I can't \"facebook stalk\" anymore. When hearing about someone a friend is dating, or when looking into an actor on a TV show, I can no longer go to Instagram for a glimpse of who that person is.\n\nI lose a main avenue by which I learn about news, engage with current events, and stay involved in my community.\n\nI lose access to Facebook marketplace. I lose access to my Instagram DMs. I lose visibility on the kinds of insane shit people put in my hometown Facebook group.\n\nAll of these are losses, some more serious than others, but I am emboldened by the ways I can replace these things.\n\n\nThe main plusses\n\nThe biggest main benefit for me is not that I gain back hours of time a week I might have been scrolling. The biggest benefit is that I don't have to be a part of the massive blob of attention and engagement that Facebook uses to monetize its products. If Zuck wants to go full Joe Rogan, if he thinks \"censorship\" is the most critical issue facing his platform right now, fine. I don't really want to be a part of that.\n\nThat being said, I hold no illusions that my departure \"means\" anything. The only party here that will or will not meaningfully benefit here is me. I am a grain of sand.\n\nBut there are other plusses. I don't feel a compulsion to share. I am journalling more already. I get my news from a platform that I have set up for myself (Bluesky).\n\n\nThe moment I really decided to do it\n\nWhile listening to the Hard Fork podcast, I heard a detail about all of the changes over at Meta that really struck me. Meta will be ceasing the operation of its automated moderation service. Here's how Casey Newton put it on the pod:\n\nWhat it means is, whereas before, Meta used to rely on automated systems to catch all sorts of things, not just illegal things, but also just stuff that was annoying or hurtful, stuff that was a little bit bullying, harassment. I called you a name. I called you a slur. Meta would catch that stuff in advance and maybe not show it to you. Maybe take some sort of disciplinary action against the person who sent that.\n\nWhat Zuckerberg is saying here is we are not the content moderators anymore. You are, Facebook user, Instagram user. We are now enlisting you in the fight. And we’re going to leave it to you. If you see a slur on our platform, you go ahead and report that. And then maybe we’ll take a look.\n\nThis has profoundly concerning implications. As Kevin Roose continued:\n\n...as we know, a lot of the worst stuff on Facebook happens in groups, happens in semi-private spaces with hundreds or thousands of members. And so now, I think Meta is essentially saying that it will be up to the members of those groups to report any violative content that they want to be moderated rather than having these proactive scanners going around. And you might say, what’s the big deal about that? Well, if you’re in a Stop the Steal group or a QAnon conspiracy group or a group that’s plotting an insurrection at the Capitol, which members of that group are going to be reporting each other for violating Facebook’s rules?\n\nThe two hosts then go on to talk about child safety. As Newton points out, 41 states and DC are suing Facebook for child safety related reasons. Whether it is bullying, harassment, or the distribution of child sexual abuse material, Meta is basically relying upon the very people involved in these terrible kinds of interactions to self moderate.\n\nThis is untenable for me. I find it unconscionable that Facebook, after years of allowing genocidal rhetoric, child sexual abuse material, and the incitement of violence to go poorly moderated, they are essentially throwing their hands in the air and declaring the fight over.\n\nNow, in fairness, they have repeated that anything illegal still isn't \"allowed\" on Facebook. But what good is this policy if the primary method of enforcement is the people directly involved in these infractions.\n\nSimply, these changes to content moderation will result in more violence and more death than would have otherwise occurred without them. In the past I have been able to let that slide for the benefits of using these platforms. This time around, with the cruelty of a Trump presidency around the corner, I don't think I need to make that trade-off anymore. I can get my news elsewhere, I can connect with my friends elsewhere, and I will.\n\n\nI really want to stress\n\nIt's important that I again say I won't and I can't judge anyone who chooses to remain on these platforms. My beef is not with you. I will not individualize a systemic problem. My beef is with this company and their ridiculous amount of control over our lives on the micro and macro scales.\n\nFor now, you can find me on Bluesky, (alex@alexschneidman.com), and continue to stay subscribed to this newsletter to hear from me.\n\nThe landscape of social media is already changing, and the upstarts are sold on the decentralized approach of Bluesky. I believe that they already do provide a better product than Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and TikTok, but this will only become more true as more people come to grips with the fact the larger players suck. I truly believe the future is bright.\n\nThanks for reading.

He wasn't gunna be president on Monday, so he took his hands off.</li><li>TikTok vowed to go dark Sunday, January 19. By the letter of the law, this was not strictly necessary.

The law allowed for a 90-day extension if ByteDance announced a sale to a non-“foreign adversary”-based company before the deadline. But not only has no such sale been announced, it’s also legally ambiguous whether the extension can be used after the 19th. Trump, in any case, isn’t so far using the deadline — he’s just attempting to override the law. <br><br>​Despite that reassurance, it still may not be enough to convince service providers covered by the law to reinstate TikTok. As many legal experts have pointed out, those companies&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/19/24347325/tiktok-service-providers-penalties-apple-google-orcale-trump\">could face up to about $850 billion in potential penalties</a>&nbsp;for violating the law — which was passed by a bipartisan Congress, signed by former President Joe Biden, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/17/24340235/supreme-court-tiktok-divest-ban-first-amendment\">upheld by the entire Supreme Court</a>.</blockquote><ul><li>So now the app is back to functioning, but with this kinda wild legal grey area. It's sorta up to the lawyers at Apple and Google, who as of this writing have not added TikTok back to the app store, perhaps out of hesitations surrounding the penalties they may face. By the letter of the law, these companies would face $5,000 fines for each <em>individual person</em> who accesses the app via the App Store or the Play Store.</li><li>So if you've already downloaded TikTok, you can still use it and it should be functioning normally.</li></ul><h3 id=\"from-where-i-sit\">From where I sit</h3><p>There are so, so many insane things happening here. The best way for me to fire off my hottest of takes is to answer some hypothetical and not-so-hypothetical questions.</p><p><strong>Should TikTok have been banned?</strong></p><p>So I've been on record in former entries to this blog that I think the TikTok ban is bad, done in bad faith, and deliberately strengthens Meta and Google. It basically boils down to: if we are so worried about China using our data, perhaps we should make it illegal for companies (in general) to sell our data to brokers of dubious provenance, both domestic and international.</p><p>But, in general, I am in favor of serious regulation of these companies on a few key grounds. While I would not go so far as to institute a ban for all Americans, I would require these platforms (by which I mean TikTok, X, Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube) to demonstrate radical transparency in their recommendation algorithms, showing us the metrics that they are optimizing for. If these companies want to continue to be places for free expression, then they need to spell out the ways they think that their apps actually do this. Because up until the point they are threatened with regulation, they seem to be content machines bent on getting you to watch ads.</p><p>This week I drew a metaphor about the nature of speech on these platforms, and the disingenuous \"online public square\" framing of their necessity. Imagine with me:</p><ul><li>In one situation, you are walking across a city plaza, perhaps going to meet up with your friend at the pizza place on the corner. Between you and the place is a loud, intrusive man, holding signs declaring how the end of the world is near and you must repent. This man gets in your face with a bullhorn, his signs say inflammatory things to get you to pay attention to him. You choose not to engage and just continue marching to the pizza place where you and your friend get to connect.</li><li>In another situation, you are walking in a mall, going to meet up with a friend at a clothing store. Now, though, the owners of the mall have placed dozens of loud, apocalyptic fanatics in the hallways, bathrooms, and enclosed plazas. You notice dozens of people like you, though, who come to the mall to yell back at those guys. To get to the clothing store you pass multiple of these little squabbles in the foreground of your vision, and see the lit up signs of stores in the background. To meet your friend at the clothing store you've passed a number of buzzing conversations, so-called \"debates\" in the marketplace of ideas. Once inside you actually have a lovely time with your friend, but you had to hear a couple ethnic slurs on the way.</li></ul><p>The owners of the mall in the second scenario are aware that littering the shiny floors with inflammatory speech and content meant to stoke engagement may make for a generally unpleasant experience for those who just want to shop and socialize there. But they also know that the more people they get in the mall doors, the more people will shop at the mall, boosting the store revenue and the mall value on the whole. Some people might just come to yell, but some will come to yell <em>and</em> leave with armfuls of shopping bags. Oh, and meanwhile the mall is tracking every move you make and selling it to governments and other companies.</p><p>This is not an organic \"public square;\" this is a tightly controlled environment in which the owners of the platform are incentivized to <em>make money</em>, not promote democratic values or connection between friends. In the first scenario, the pizza place on the corner is not carving out a little spot on the sidewalk for the fanatic to speak their mind. In fact they might want him gone so that people are unobstructed getting into the business. In the first situation, you are not <em>forced</em> to reckon with people you don't know spouting off about things you might not care about. You can put your headphones in, cross the street, whatever. It is, after all, a public square. In the second situation it is <em>everywhere</em>, and being deliberately carried out by the mall owners to get bodies into the mall. As far as I know, city officials don't drag and drop obnoxious street preachers to areas where they want more people to shop.</p><p>Problem is that our internet is made up of a bunch of malls.</p><p>I think all of this should be illegal or highly regulated. I think if a company wants to genuinely promote free speech then they should be required to demonstrate that in technological disclosures. I think if a company wants to platform inflammatory speech to get eyes on ads, then they should be required to disclose exactly how they do this, and should not be available for children.</p><p>So do I support the TikTok ban? No, not in its current iteration. But I do think that we need rigorous privacy laws, ironclad disclosure requirements, and a healthy ecosystem of options for expression that do not require playing by the mall rules.</p><p><strong>Where else is there to go?</strong></p><p>Speaking of a healthy ecosystem, we don't really have one. Right now there certainly are other platforms that are not TYFIX (TikTok, YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, and X). Places like Bluesky and Mastodon, but they are not nearly as large. Why? Well a big reason is that, because they are not profit machines, they do not receive a lot of investment like the other platforms. This is why avenues for free information, like Wikipedia or ProPublica, are constantly asking for donations. Legitimate discourse doesn't pay, \"THE END IS NIGH\" does.</p><p>Currently I am aware of two projects attempting to recreate the Instagram and TikTok feature sets on the ATProtocol, the open, decentralized platform on which Bluesky was created. They are called <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/15/bluesky-is-getting-its-own-photo-sharing-app-flashes/\">Flashes</a> and <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/skylight.social\">Skylight</a>. I believe so, so firmly that these places will be more like the open-air city plaza where you met your friend for pizza than the profit machine of the mall. Might they still have ads? Might they still have insane rhetoric on them? Yes, but the entire idea is that you will get to <em>choose</em> whether of not you engage with these things. Not have them force fed to you so a product manager in Menlo Park can reach the KPIs that ensure their bonus.</p><p><strong>What if the US Govt bought TikTok?</strong></p><p>On Truth Social, Trump made this ludicrous suggestion that the US government should buy a controlling majority of TikTok.

You may have seen headlines with a company called DeepSeek and a company called Nvidia. I'm here to explain what is happening in a broader context and hopefully you'll leave understanding why it might matter to you. And if it doesn't matter to you? That's fine too!\n\n\nWho is Nvidia?\n\nNvidia is an American company that makes computer chips. They rose to prominence initially by making really good GPUs, or graphics processing units, which are great for running video games or really intense video editing software. But! It turns out that what makes the chips great at those things also makes them great for training artificial intelligence.\n\nSo, over the last few years, Nvidia has become, at times, the world's most valuable company. Every single major AI or computing company is trying to buy these chips, and investors are dying to get a piece of the pie. More chips, more training. More training, better models. Better models, ????, profit.\n\nIt is important to note, though, that while Nvidia is an American company, the vast majority of the actual manufacturing that goes into producing their chips is done by a company in Taiwan called TSMC.\n\n\nChina and DeepSeek\n\nIn the hopes that the US can stifle AI development in China, multiple restrictions have been put in place by the government in order to make it more difficult for Chinese firms to access the technology they need to train models on par with the leading US ones.\n\nBiden administration to announce new rule curbing sale of AI chips to China, RussiaSecretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo said the new policy will help build a trusted technology ecosystem around the world.USA TODAY, USA TODAY\n\nHere's an analogy if this all feels like a lot. Imagine all the sewing machines are made in your country. Since you don't want another country to produce high quality clothing efficiently, you tell the sewing machine companies in your country that they aren't allowed to sell their product to clothing makers in the other country.\n\nNvidia chips are our sewing machines.\n\nThen a Chinese company, DeepSeek, revealed a new large language model. According to some industry benchmarks, their models are in the conversation with the leading American models from OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic. But wait? If they don't have the best tech, how come they are able to get similar results?\n\nI first heard about this on January 10th in an episode of the Hard Fork podcast from the New York Times. Kevin Roose, reporter for the Times, detailed a report from DeepSeek that their new model, DeepSeek-V3, was trained for $5.5 million. That might seem like a lot, but it's reported that OpenAI and Anthropic spent over $100 million to train their leading models, ChatGPT-4o and Claude 3.5 Sonnet.\n\nDeepSeek, running on older Nvidia hardware, spending a fraction of the American companies, was able to produce results on par with the heavy spending US firms. Allegedly. This is from their own reports, but the evidence seems to suggest that it is true.\n\nTo extend our analogy from earlier: Your country didn't sell them the sewing machines, and they still figured out how to make clothes as good as yours.\n\nBy restricting access to the most advanced chips, the US essentially gave engineers in China a science challenge: How do we produce similar results with inferior tech? Necessity is the mother of invention, and the geniuses at DeepSeek were able to figure it out.\n\nFor a moment I just want to stop and acknowledge how profound, impressive, and important this is. Our current two main drawbacks to training and then deploying AI are that it is insanely expensive and extremely energy hungry. This breakthrough suggests that it could cost way less and, importantly, use less energy.\n\nBut there are, as is evident by the panicked headlines, larger economic drawbacks.\n\n\nTony Stark was able to build this in a cave with a box of scraps\n\nIn my second newsletter from last week, I wrote about lies. In a sense, economic bubbles are a sort of lie. Enough people artificially inflate the value of a certain good based on a series of assumptions. The trillions of dollars of investment in AI in the last two years has been based on assumptions such as: AI is here to stay and is a transformative technological platform shift, you need the best chips to train the best AI, and it is necessary to move fast in order to compete with both domestic and international players.\n\nAll of these assumptions could be true over a range of outcomes, but they are still assumptions. And they are assumptions that made American AI companies hubristic and shortsighted. When the piles and piles of cash are pouring in every day to the likes of Sam Altman or Jensen Huang (the CEO of Nvidia), it is hard to imagine that anything you're doing could possibly be wrong.\n\nThis is how a bubble forms. Investor optimism has far outpaced the demonstrated utility of AI and the necessity of having the best chips, and Nvidia's stock price is reflective of this. After all, if Tony Stark (DeepSeek) were able to build this (a high performing modern AI model) with a box of scraps (old GPUs), why the hell are we spending all this money?\n\nPeople have been predicting that AI is a \"bubble\" in some sense for a bit now. I attended a virtual debate last fall in which only one person, media analyst Evan Shapiro, argued that we were in fact in a bubble. I followed up with him then to complain about how much I agreed with him and the empirical evidence he used to support his claim. All of the other people seemed to just be supported by magic. I have expected this bubble to pop, but I really was not expecting a potential first rip this soon.\n\n\nThe dirty bubble\n\nAny sort of economic bubble is not good. While I'm glad to have been proven a little correct by seeing Nvidia's stock plummet, the end result is mostly economic decay in the form of layoffs and stagnation. You don't get that money back.\n\nAI is supposed to bring data centers and super computers onto American soil. It's supposed to create engineering jobs both for the AI companies and the infrastructure necessary to keep these products operating. We're supposed to build renewable energy sources to accommodate the energy needs of the industry.\n\nThe point of trillions of dollars of investment is to, at some point, make all of that back and then some across the economy. If this whole time we could do it for cheaper, then we'll start to. And when we do, companies will lay off workers.\n\nThink for a moment about how embarrassing this is. Sam Altman was out here hoping for $7 trillion. Burn more money on it, and it'll go faster was a sort of guiding principle. But that's not true, and the writing is on the wall.\n\nIs AI hitting a wall?Now, the buzz is turning to ‘reasoning’ and AI agents.The Verge\n\nThe unmitigated hype and salesmanship of a few men kept American companies from really going after the most important innovations, leaving China a wide open opportunity to show the world that these models can run for cheaper, on older hardware, and with less energy.\n\nAll of this could have devastating downstream effects if the bubble really does pop. Like the tulips in the 17th century Netherlands, or the Dot com bust in the early 2000s, or the housing crash in 2008, it's not like their negative ramifications begin and end at discrete industry sector borders.\n\nAs of publication, Nvidia stock has dropped almost 18% from its Friday closing price to its current price. It's market cap has dropped around $600 billion (with a big ol' B). This one company lost more value than the entire GDP of Ireland.\n\nSo what to make of all of this? Hopefully the marketplace is robust and diversified enough to absorb this massive blow. What's certain is that we should be taking the words of American AI CEOs with a chunky grain of salt. After all, even they couldn't see this coming.","feature_image":"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1591405351990-4726e331f141?crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&fit=max&fm=jpg&ixid=M3wxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDJ8fG52aWRpYXxlbnwwfHx8fDE3MzgwMDgxNzd8MA&ixlib=rb-4.0.3&q=80&w=2000","featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","email_recipient_filter":"all","created_at":"2025-01-27T20:01:47.000Z","updated_at":"2025-01-27T20:04:43.000Z","published_at":"2025-01-27T20:04:43.000Z","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null,"newsletter_id":"66f029f981a59700086b0e28","show_title_and_feature_image":1},{"id":"679a4ea1a1a6e100016ec302","uuid":"01f87b30-89be-45a8-ae9c-ed60b7ab56df","title":"The Toy In The Bubble","slug":"the-toy-in-the-bubble","mobiledoc":null,"lexical":"{\"root\":{\"children\":[{\"children\":[{\"detail\":0,\"format\":0,\"mode\":\"normal\",\"style\":\"\",\"text\":\"As someone pretty keyed into the world of tech, I have observed a kind of narrative escalation around AI this week.

In some analysis I've heard and read, the news around DeepSeek was the biggest tectonic shift in AI since OpenAI dropped ChatGPT in December 2022. I've seen the geopolitical angle, I've seen the scientific angle, I wrote about the hubris angle. It is all anyone is talking about on the roster of podcasts and newsletters to which I am subscribed. But I want to take a step aside and offer some thoughts on what I think is the most important question surrounding AI: Who gives a shit?\n\n\nThe Promise\n\nLike charismatic preachers looking for the next revival, the men who run the tech industry in the US have spent years now spreading the gospel of AI. They make remarkable claims, nothing short of \"We can cure cancer and extend the human lifespan.\" They have told us from the jump that the stakes really, truly are that high.\n\nAnd the thing is! They could be right! With AI, we can find sophisticated new ways of analyzing and managing scientific data. The insights we could derive from this analysis really could help us address climate change, really could help us discover cancer inhibiting proteins, or really could help us find inventive new treatments for dementia. And there are companies out there doing this work, pointing their incredibly powerful computers at these datasets and these problems. The only problem is that OpenAI, Google, or Microsoft are not those companies.\n\nTo be fair, all three of the listed businesses and their contemporaries do have sizable investments in these utopian ideas. But since that's not where they will make money, they are not where the focus lies.\n\nTo be a little uncharitable and blunt, these companies are focussed on making job replacement machines.\n\nRecently, the trend in AI is to build \"agentic\" systems that can carry out actions for humans.\n\nOpenAI’s new Operator AI agent can do things on the web for youIt’s launching as a “research preview.”The VergeJay Peters\n\nThe promise of these systems is to boost productivity, to ease work-life balance, and to give humans time back to do human stuff, like garden or paint or whatever.\n\nBut still I arrive at the same question: Who gives a shit?\n\n\nI'll tell you who\n\nIf they are making job replacement machines, then the \"who\" is who hires and fires.\n\nI've said it before, but it bears repeating, that the single biggest expenditure for American companies is labor costs. This, after all, is a useful lens through which to observe the now ritual outsourcing of American jobs overseas or the proliferation of the benefit-less, stability-less gig economy.\n\nGiven the chance, companies will opt for the cheaper labor option, even if it means deprecation in efficiency, quality, or customer satisfaction. I'm not necessarily placing a value judgement on that here, although I certainly have some feelings about it. But I think it is fair to say.\n\nSo whether it's Salesforce or OpenAI or whoever writes the highest checks to A-list Hollywood talent to appear in their commercials, they are trying to sell their vision to the check writers of industry. The thing is, though, is that that is certainly not everyone, and that certainly does not a seismic reorientation of consumer technology make.\n\nTake, for example, the litany of project management software on which much of the American \"knowledge\" economy runs. Off the top of my head, here are a few: Atlassian's Jira and Confluence, Workday, SAP, Salesforce, Trello. These are successful, meaningful businesses, but what they are not are beloved, transformational technologies. They might improve productivity in one way or another, simplifying things like payroll or task management, but it is not as if every person on planet Earth needs these apps on their phone in order to function in modern society.\n\nSure, you could argue that I am being overly dismissive, but I would remind AI evangelists that none of their companies are profitable (yet), their products are not societally ubiquitous, and their loftiest claims about what artificial super-intelligence could do are not even halfway validated by their existing consumer tech.\n\nIt might be incredibly reductive of me to say, but I still find that AI is still in a \"fuck around\" phase. They are still trying to convince us of its utility without actually demonstrating utility. When they \"find out,\" it would be really great to let us all know, but for now they are asking for all of the money on the planet (literally) based on what it all could mean.\n\n\nIdle hands are the devil's playthings\n\nMany of the ways that AI is supposed to change the lives of everyday people amount to new ways of doing old things. Many are just for fun. Want a new way to write emails? Sure! A new way to send emoji? Here ya go. How about a new way to make playlists, or get movie recommendations, or learn what a book is about? Check, check, and check.\n\nI think it might be fair to say, though, that these are not societally transformational ideas. When the internet came around, it did not change that people wanted movie recommendations, just how they got them. AI doesn't feel much different to me.\n\nThe ability to generate novelty poems or G-rated fan fiction is not dissimilar to the delight derived from a toy capsule vending machine. The LLM is several incredible leaps and bounds more advanced, but at the end of the day the AI they are trying to sell us looks more like the colorful toys in the crane machine than it does the crane, or the electricity that powers it, or the general human desire for entertainment.\n\nMany examples of AI's purported necessity put forth by the companies attempting to sell it pretty roundly amount to a \"Wow, that's neat\" from the general public. But you can say the same about a magic trick.\n\n\nHow AI will change the world\n\nDespite all of my skepticism, I do genuinely and actually believe that AI will change the world. I just am suspicious that that'll be done by the companies doing it now focussing on the things that they are now. Here are two examples:\n\n * Imagine a world with the absolute highest efficiency of energy consumption, one where the grid automatically and proactively distributes power according to need and nothing gets wasted. Imagine this on the scale of a home or apartment building too. This is an extremely powerful and not-really-all-that-far-fetched idea for something AI can help us with, providing really meaningful savings in cost and in energy consumption. These same fundamental ideas can map themselves onto water consumption, internet availability, waste management, you name it.\n * Imagine a world with the absolute highest efficiency of food distribution.

Using AI we can optimize the output of these types of institutions to decrease reliance on distant factory farms, saving on the costs and emissions of trucking fresh vegetables across the country.\n\n\nWhy I think it's a bubble\n\nThere are a bunch of reasons, but as it relates to the theme of this newsletter the answer basically boils down to a derisive dismissal that the productivity or cost benefits on the other side of this first AI wave will outpace the insane level of investment.

As other names were being floated for this role, some analysts were surprised at the selection. While we shouldn't necessarily take the votes from confirmation hearings as a barometer for a nominee's cross-aisle appeal, Bessent was confirmed with a 68 to 29 vote, meaning 15 Democrats voted with all the Republicans to confirm him. He has been seen as a level-headed, \"adult in the room\" type, especially when compared with other Trump cabinet members (Hegseth and Noem) and nominees (Kash Patel, RFK Jr). Also, he's gay!</p><p><strong>Who is Elon Musk?</strong></p><p>Since you're on this email list I presume I don't need to write that much here. Would \"insecure supremacist loser with a desire to be seen as a savant-like genius despite his general inadequacy in many areas of human life, including the love of one's children\" suffice? He's also on a bad faith crusade to cut down on government waste and spending under a made up banner called the Department of Government Efficiency.</p><p><strong>What's the Treasury Department?</strong></p><p>It might be obvious to some, but it certainly has not always been obvious to me what the Treasury actually <em>does</em>. Essentially, they are the country's bank. Federal taxes get collected here, money gets minted, loans and bonds get disbursed, and payments get made. This last bit, for today's story, is the most important.</p><p><strong>What is this \"tool\" that Bessent gave Musk access to?</strong></p><p>Let's say you go out to dinner with your friends. Check comes. The place is cash only. You're the only person with cash! All of your friends take the receipt and tally up what to request from you and then you dole out the funds to pay for the meal.</p><p>The Treasury department has a tool for paying out things. When the EPA or the FDA or some other federal program needs to accept funding, they make a request of the Treasury, and the Treasury basically writes a big ol' check. It's probably not literally a big ol' check, but you get the idea.

Who else receives payments from the federal government? Try millions of Americans who receive Social Security benefits. These are individual people who have provided the government their physical addresses and/or their bank information for direct deposits. In order to track fraud, send correct payments, and just generally stay organized, the Treasury has to have a database. That database likely includes millions of first and last names, home addresses, email addresses, phone numbers, bank routing/account numbers, birth dates, Social Security numbers, and in many cases, death dates.</p><p>I know I tend to pull a lot of metaphor and analogy out when addressing real world issues. But I want you to imagine for a moment that at the company for which you work, an outside, non-hired person shows up. The CFO hands that person the admin login information for whatever employee management software your company uses. They could, say, make it so that you don't receive your next direct deposit. They could, say, stop making payments to the outside marketing firm your company uses. This is essentially what is happening here.</p><p>Elon Musk, not just an unelected man, but a man who hasn't been confirmed to any position in the federal government by elected officials, has been given the Venmo of the US government, and can see all of its transactions. Elon Musk, owner of SpaceX, is a government contractor that has received payments from the very system he was just granted access to. If he wants to stop the flow of payments to his competitors in aerospace, he could. If he wanted to decide that so and so's grandma actually isn't entitled to retirement benefits, or so and so's buddy isn't actually disabled \"enough\" to receive disability benefits, he could.</p><p>Flatly and plainly: this is corruption. Under false pretenses of \"curbing government spending,\" the Treasury Secretary just handed Elon and the president the handles of probably one of the most powerful corruption tools that exists on the planet.

Not to express too much empathy for a group whose ranks include a guy who wrote about how \"the Deep State\" thwarted unrepentant sludge puddle Matt Gaetz, but I do not envy the fact that they will now be the targets of state-level disruption from adversaries looking to, I don't know, gain access to the United States' means of funding itself.</p><p>You may find yourself wondering why the world's richest man has to rely on teenage boys to help him get things done, even in the federal government. I think there are a few reasons, including that they probably admire him like a hero or that they provide a sense of validation to him that he does not receive from his own family. I think the most Occam's razoriest answer though is simply that he can exploit their labor, pay them nothing, claim the credit for the actually hard stuff, and dispose of them without much recourse when they are no longer useful to him.</p><h3 id=\"isnt-this-a-techsocietymediaculture-newsletter-this-feels-like-a-lotta-politics\">Isn't this a tech/society/media/culture newsletter?

It gets worse!\n\nThe Young, Inexperienced Engineers Aiding Elon Musk’s Government TakeoverEngineers between 19 and 24, most linked to Musk’s companies, are playing a key role as he seizes control of federal infrastructure.WIREDVittoria Elliott\n\nSunday, Wired reported that 6 boys, appearing to be between 19 and 24, are part of Musk's shadow front of unelected and unvetted private citizens who have been given access to these tools.\n\nThese boys, whose ideologies seem to align with Musk's, are bright young people who, yes, are ostensibly adults who can make their own decisions, but who are also caught in the sway of the world's richest man. Not to express too much empathy for a group whose ranks include a guy who wrote about how \"the Deep State\" thwarted unrepentant sludge puddle Matt Gaetz, but I do not envy the fact that they will now be the targets of state-level disruption from adversaries looking to, I don't know, gain access to the United States' means of funding itself.\n\nYou may find yourself wondering why the world's richest man has to rely on teenage boys to help him get things done, even in the federal government. I think there are a few reasons, including that they probably admire him like a hero or that they provide a sense of validation to him that he does not receive from his own family. I think the most Occam's razoriest answer though is simply that he can exploit their labor, pay them nothing, claim the credit for the actually hard stuff, and dispose of them without much recourse when they are no longer useful to him.\n\n\nIsn't this a tech/society/media/culture newsletter? This feels like a lotta politics!\n\nYes. Thank you for reminding me. You know what would have really helped in a situation like this? Any kind of federal data privacy law. A law that prevents the government or third parties from gaining access to your data without explicit consent. Or, I don't know, a law that simply prevents non-government officials from gaining access to civilian data?\n\nLet's sprinkle a little bit more tech stuff in here.\n\nWarning: This is about to get preeeeetty weedsy for the average reader. If you don't care about CMS's or web management, this might be boring. Long story short, the Trump administration doesn't really know wtf it's doing with all these sites, and it could be illegal. It definitely should be illegal.\n\nOne thing I've been following is this story about content being removed from government sites. As you can see in the article above, thousands of pages have been removed. With my understanding of the relationship between content management systems and legal departments, I can say confidently that the site admins in control of these removals are not going through any sort of rigorous process of review and removal. While I worked with a consumer allergy medication company, we even had to get legal approval to remove pieces of information from the site, including minor details in images, captions, and ALT text.\n\nWhat appears to be happening is Trump appointed or Trump loyal users are gaining site admin status for each department, practically doing a CMD-F shortcut to find any mentions of vaccines, women, minorities, gender, or sexuality, and hitting a trash icon in their backend content management system. It would be my guess that each department or office has their own CMS, which means going into every single .gov website and ham-fistedly deleting things. It is a cumbersome, tedious process, and not one that a person who maybe had spent time building these sites would really love doing.\n\nI want to draw your attention to one site I have been checking in on since last week. This is the page for the federal government's Small Business Administration. Perhaps you've heard of SBA loans, but the department also provides resources and mentorship to small business upstarts.\n\nThe site includes pages of resources for the following groups: women, Native Americans, veterans, military spouses, LGBTQ people, rural business owners, and minority business owners. Considering the Trump administration and the Republicans at best ignore these groups and at worst wish to stamp them out of society, I am surprised these resources are still up. My guess, for right now, is that they simply haven't gotten to them, but this runs counter to another detail I dug up while investigating the site.\n\nUsing the Wayback Machine, I was able to find the page for the former Office of Diversity, Inclusion and Civil Rights at SBA. Right now, that page displays a 403 error; the site recognizes the request, it just won't fulfill it. Plus when going to the bio pages for Zina Sutch and Gaye Walker, the two people who ran this office, you get the following message:\n\nThese details tell me a few things. One, these site removals are not being done through real site managers, who would see to it that going to these pages provided redirects, even to just the homepage of the site. That's basic practice. Two, the content from these pages is not gone so much as it is hidden. To the end user, these states are basically interchangeable, but on the backend there's a big difference. It tells me that the content of those pages is still sitting in whatever instance of their CMS they are using. But why? Why not just truly go for it and delete it?\n\nFinally, this runs counter to my guess that lackeys haven't gotten to those pages yet because, well, if these other pages were removed, it would have been fairly easy to remove the ones I mentioned above.\n\nI can't draw many meaningful conclusions from all of this that wouldn't be wildly speculative, but what it tells me is that the bad faith actors operating in the Trump administration are not some wildly brilliant super villains. They are clumsy, hyperactive marks. They are beatable and they are ready to be out maneuvered.\n\nThat's all for today folks. Shout out the First Amendment for Constitutionally protecting what you just read. Thanks so much for reading. On Thursday, I'll have a piece out I've been meaning to do for sometime. I'll be talking through my own personal AI beliefs, and outline some general practices I try to adhere to.

Today I want to talk about how I think about AI chatbots, why I use them, and some things I think about as I introduce them into my life.</p><p>Just to get it out of the way, it's important I say that what follows here is not an endorsement or a condemnation of AI or how you in particular might use it or not use it. These are just reflections from someone who has thought about this <em>a lot</em>. So let's get started.</p><h3 id=\"why-i-use-ai-chatbots\">Why I use AI chatbots</h3><h4 id=\"executive-functioning\">Executive Functioning</h4><p>A few years ago, I learned what I kinda always knew: I am neurodivergent and have been my entire life. One thing this causes me to struggle with is executive functioning. Executive functioning primarily refers to the brain's ability to make plans, complete tasks, and prioritize information. AI chatbots are an incredible tool to help organize spiraling thoughts, to break down to-dos into manageable portions, and to affirm myself. An example of this might include info-dumping all of the things I need to get done in a morning into the chatbot and prompting it to help me prioritize what to do first.</p><h4 id=\"the-generalists-multitool\">The Generalist's Multitool</h4><p>In the parable of the fox and the hedgehog, I am definitely the fox. I love taking a broad look when exploring and attaining new information, so I tend to know a little bit about a lot of things instead of a lot about one thing. AI chatbots, having been trained on the collective output of all human created information, allow me to tumble down a trail of \"why\" questions in an efficient and context specific way. For example, I love building games but I lack the coding ability to bring some of my more creative ideas to life. AI's proficiency in both these technical skills and in garnering my intent sets it apart from typical Google search.</p><h4 id=\"context-specific-inquiry\">Context specific inquiry</h4><p>AI chatbots currently have a major leg up on typical search engines in their access to the user's exact context. When asking a question online, I may find an answer for someone who was in a slightly different situation than I am in, and then I have to adapt the results I find to my circumstances. This can come with my own assumptions and knowledge, which is not complete, as evidenced by the fact that I made a search in the first place. Using images, text, and other files I can inquire with the bot about things that are currently in front of my face.</p><h3 id=\"how-i-use-ai-chatbots\">How I use AI chatbots</h3><h4 id=\"research-assistant\">Research assistant</h4><p>A common use for these things, especially for writers and journalists, is as a research assistant. Now, some yellow flags should go up when you hear this. <strong><em>AI chatbots do not \"know\" things and should not be trusted to provide factual information.</em></strong> But! They do know a lot about existing media and resources, so if you are looking to do a deep dive on Reconstruction Era America you can find the institutions, authors, books, and other documentation to focus your exploration. When I want to learn more about a topic, I will ask Claude for documentaries, YouTubers, books, essays, you name it. Will it provide the most extensive, detailed list for me? Almost certainly not. But it will provide a jumping off point to go in search of more information.</p><p>I think of AI like a really fancy glossary/index at the back of a book. It is not the content, it is a place to start to engage with the content.</p><h4 id=\"writing-feedback\">Writing feedback</h4><p>Recently I downloaded all of the text of this newsletter dating back to September and fed it to Claude. I asked it to tell me what the pieces are about, what my strengths are, and areas in which I could improve this newsletter. I was stunned by the thoroughness and depth of how it responded, and have already begun to use those responses to support the work I do.</p><h4 id=\"media-recommendation\">Media recommendation</h4><p>Given how large language models work, they are exceptionally good at recognizing latent patterns between seemingly disparate things. This makes them very good media recommendation tools. To find something to watch or listen to, I will prompt the bot with some of my favorite films, TV shows, music, and podcasts. It does a great job finding things I might never have heard of, or providing evidence around things that I <em>have</em> heard of that would specifically make me interested in them.</p><h4 id=\"coding-projects\">Coding projects</h4><p>I have no idea, really, how to code. I've tried to learn multiple times, but I found that I would grasp how it worked and never how to make it work for me. It's also hard to learn a new language. Using my product management experience and generalist approach, I love using AI to develop games, tools, and sites.</p><h4 id=\"context-specific-inquiry-1\">Context specific inquiry</h4><p>As mentioned above, I use AI to help me with context specific needs. As an example, I use AI when I'm cooking. I use the camera to show the bot what I'm looking at, I use the chat to share the recipe, and I provide the bot with the understanding that I am not a particularly good or experienced cook. It can quickly give me tips and reassure me in ways that a YouTube video or online cooking blog can't get to.</p><h3 id=\"how-i-definitely-do-not-use-ai\">How I definitely do not use AI</h3><h4 id=\"anything-factual\">Anything factual</h4><p>You can probably get away with asking a chatbot what year a celebrity was born, but I would not trust or rely upon them for factual information. To see how tall the Eiffel Tower is, what years WWII was fought, or the contents of an American law, I would not ask an AI. These systems are not designed in the way that search engines are. If enough of the bot's training data, for example, says that the South was fighting for \"states rights\" during the civil war, the bot will tell you that this is the case.</p><h4 id=\"anything-i-am-claiming-as-my-own-work\">Anything I am claiming as my own work</h4><p>This is my guarantee to you that this newsletter will never, ever comprise of AI generated content. I have used AI to help me outline and guide the thesis of my work, but I have never and never plan to use it as a replacement for my work. I have my own personal philosophical reasons for this, but one that may matter to you is that these models were built on stolen human data, and I am unwilling to hand over my style and specific thoughts to a flattened, desaturated conglomerate of all English language writing.</p><h3 id=\"some-important-policies-i-adhere-to\">Some important policies I adhere to</h3><h4 id=\"i-dont-use-anything-i-dont-understand\">I don't use anything I don't understand</h4><p>I have spent hours learning about the history of LLMs, how they are trained, and how they work. There is <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDNU6R1_67000Dx_ZCJB-3pi\">an excellent series from the YouTube creator 3Blue1Brown</a> that I used to do this self education. I believe that it is extremely important that as many people as possible understand how these systems work, how they don't, and how they will effect our lives. I use my understanding to make the AI work for <em>me.</em> Many online systems that are usable for free (Google search, Reddit, Facebook) are making you work for them, and I use AI as an alternative out of that paradigm.</p><h4 id=\"adjust-for-sycophancy-bias\">Adjust for sycophancy bias</h4><p>Chatbots do this thing where they want to please you. They are biased toward making the user feel nice, correct, and validated, even if the user is incredibly wrong. In the example I wrote earlier about sharing my writing with Claude, I never said who the writer was, referring to the writer with they/them pronouns. I trusted the response the bot gave me more because it was not trying to make me feel good about myself.</p><h4 id=\"anthropic-over-openai-google-and-microsoft\">Anthropic over OpenAI, Google, and Microsoft</h4><p>There are four main US consumer AI products. Claude from Anthropic, ChatGPT from OpenAI, Gemini from Google, and Copilot from Microsoft. There are affirmative reasons why I use Anthropic, I promise, but I try to stay away from companies profiting off of genocide or war, licking the boot of a fascistic president, or whose privacy practices give me significant pause. OpenAI, Google, and Microsoft either are currently doing these things or aspire to in some way.</p><p>Anthropic as a company has put its weight behind understanding how LLMs work, challenging accelerationist ideas in the industry, and aligning its AI with positive, humanist values. I find that Claude's tone is easier to read and digest than any of the other ones, and just generally enjoy chatting with it more than the others.</p><h3 id=\"the-two-biggest-drawbacks\">The two biggest drawbacks</h3><p>I don't want to ignore the two giant elephants in the room as it relates to AI.</p><h4 id=\"environmental-concerns\">Environmental concerns</h4><p>I have seen a number of unsourced claims about how much more energy AI inquiries use than a given Google search. From the top to the bottom of an AI inquiry, including the data centers and the processing power, it is pretty incontrovertible that using AI draws more power than a typical Google search. The differences can be argued, but it's definitely true.</p><p>Two things I want to address about this, though. First, the <em>vast majority</em> of the energy used on AI happens in training, not in inference. The direct relationship between your AI inquiry and dramatically increased emissions is comparable to your relationship to the truck emissions from the kale provider to your local Sweetgreen (N.B. I'm not saying literally the numbers are the same, just the indirect relationship).</p><p>Second, many Google searches are <em>already being supplemented with AI responses</em>. So even if you aren't explicitly asking for it, Google is making AI requests for you anyway.</p><p>If you want to mitigate AI's impact on the environment, simply not using it is an understandable avenue, but the companies with the most direct impact on these emissions are Amazon (via Amazon Web Services), Google (via its enterprise cloud offerings), and Microsoft (via Azure). Divesting your digital and economic life from these places is an important and higher impact way to address this problem.</p><p>Am I saying not to use Google search? Yes.</p><h4 id=\"stolen-material\">Stolen material</h4><p>Another common drawback is the claim that these chatbots are trained on stolen material. Simply, they are. These companies have <em>literally</em> scraped the entire content of the web, including copyrighted material, to train their models that they now want us to pay for. There are a number of copyright related lawsuits from high powered institutions like The New York Times against OpenAI, for example, to address this and provide recourse.</p><p>This robbery is the explicit reason I do not use these models for text or images that I claim as my own. As a writer, I do not want someone to be able to pay an AI company to write like me without my consent, approval, or explicit compensation.</p><p>An unfortunate reality, though, is that the robbery has already happened, and these companies are not all that sensitive to requests to have stolen content removed from their corpus of data. This is most true of smaller creative workers who do not have the legal department of a place like The New York Times to support them.</p><p>Already I have seen anecdotes of writers and other artists shielding their material from AI webscrapers.

Because YouTube has history as an audience management platform for users, it has a leg up on TikTok and Instagram Reels.

Hope there isn't more Elon Musk stuff to write about!</p>","comment_id":"67ae6d81f7b5710001d48754","plaintext":"It's tough out here. You want to be an active part of modernity, but you don't want to feel complicit in all of its woes! What a conundrum! Today I want to share some of how I think it can be good to think about these problems, as well as list some \"ways out\" of the influence of companies that extract more from us than they give.\n\n\nWhy do this?\n\nThere are a number of reasons people may want to adjust how their dollars and attention interact with the economy. Even the companies know this. Across industries, we see marketing appeals to all sorts of \"ethics based\" reasons people might have for choosing one product over another. You've seen ducks cleaned by Dawn soap, you've seen \"Honest\" household and beauty products, you've seen frantic Apple commercials condemning the surveillance practices of certain internet browsers.\n\nPeople have values, and in our current economy, values are positively correlated with dollars. Whether we want to avoid forced or child labor, or animal cruelty, or toxic waste, or surveillance capitalism, whatever your bend might be.\n\nLeaving aside the effectiveness of diverting your money to align with your values, there is something to holding yourself to a consistent, actionable set of ideals. To an extent, your individual spending choices don't have much of a recognizable effect on the companies you seek to divert from, but that alone is not reason enough to stop caring altogether. In fact, as Americans it is a privilege to have the choices we have at all.\n\nSo yes, boycotts are good and work, but also just simply scanning through where you put your attention - and where it is being taken from you - can be a useful practice.\n\nAlso, remember this: Harm reduction is always good. It is always better to make something just a little bit better than to not have done anything at all. With that, I want to share some different ways technology can help you reduce harms, to yourself and to the world.\n\n\nSome ways out\n\nUp front, I want to say that the things I'm about to share are not all things I necessarily use or have used. They are meant to be jumping off points or inspiration for you to think about different ways you might interact with social media, the internet, or media. Anyway, here are five areas I think are relatively easy ways to align what you do with more humanist, collectivist values.\n\nReading\n\nWhen you really stop and think about it, it's insane that written text has never been more accessible technologically yet there is really just one company that dominates book sales. One source I found suggests that 71% of people who bought a book in 2023 bought it through an Amazon service. For some perspective, this is larger market share than Apple has in the US smartphone industry.\n\nAmazon is able to capture this vast majority by leveraging their convenience and the restrictions of reading books on a Kindle. In short, buying a book through the Kindle service allows you to only read that book via your Kindle device or app. For something as basic as reading, it seems kind of wild that this is, uh, allowed. Imagine for a moment only being allowed to watch NBCUniversal content if you have Comcast internet or cable.\n\nFortunately, there are alternatives. I have been a Rakuten Kobo e-reader user for over a year now, and I love it. The title selection is virtually the same, but their devices allow for more interoperability with other applications and services. They have a serviceable iOS app just like Kindle, and integrations with Libby and Overdrive.\n\nFor purchasing books, I've been following Bookshop.org for some time now. Bookshop.org matches the convenience of Amazon online book shopping with the good will created by directly supporting local independent bookstores. Plus, recently Bookshop.org made it possible to buy ebooks from their service.\n\nThere are obviously issues with the publishing industry, including conglomeration and failure to meaningfully combat Amazon's monopoly, but the more people that demand the interoperable, independent future that Kobo or Bookshop are heralding the closer we get.\n\nInternet search and browsing\n\nArachne is littered with barbs against Google. I'm only a little sorry about it, namely because I have friends that work there, lol. Estimations have Google Chrome at around 67% of global internet browser marketshare. For Google Search it is 90%. Because there is limited competition, people who make stuff for the internet are strongly incentivized to make things that work best for Google products. There's an entire SEO industry predicated on this idea.\n\nBut there's also the human cost. Chrome and Search are free to use, so they survive by extracting mounds and mounds of data from users. Then they can turn around and train their AIs or sell to data brokers off the back of your work. Literally. I spend about five hours a week on this newsletter, and if I want it to show up in Google searches I have to approve of Google's webcrawlers scanning and scraping everything I put up here. There's nothing really stopping Google from loading what I write into their training for Gemini.\n\n(For the pedants, yes, you can block these webcrawlers if you want. But I don't own the domain for arachne.ghost.io, so in this case I cannot do that.)\n\nFortunately, there are alternatives. If you are a Chrome user and want to switch, it's fairly easy to go to a ready-made option like Safari. You can even export your bookmarks and load them into a new browser. If you want to go a step further, there are third party browsers like Brave, Vivaldi, and (for the real sickos) Tor.\n\nFor Search, I cannot recommend Kagi enough. Do you miss how Google search worked like 15 years ago? Do you want to customize what appears at the top of your search results? Kagi makes these things extremely easy, and it can be integrated with virtually any browser. You can try it for free, and then it costs money.\n\nYouTube is better than TikTok and Instagram\n\nAlright, alright. I know I just spent a bunch of time railing against Google. But life is not a zero-sum game. YouTube is, unequivocally, a better platform for creative labor than TikTok or Instagram. There are a few key ways in which this is true.\n\n * Revenue sharing: YouTube's advertising revenue sharing program (generally) doles out more than half of the accrued ad revenue on a video to the video's creator.

This is why, for example, creators are finding other avenues for revenue and audience discovery like video podcasts, Patreon, and newsletters. YouTube has more tools for getting creator audiences into these alternative spaces than TikTok or IG.\n\nNews and Social Media\n\nHere is my recommendation in a nutshell: Pay for worker owned news. Subscribe to independent media. Avoid algorithmic news aggregation.\n\nAmerica's news infrastructure is pretty fucked. Local, independent news has taken a nosedive. The larger players are capitulating pedants or safe havens for reactionary centrism. Journalists have to start Substacks to survive, counting on a place that platforms Nazis to support themselves.

If, for example, NBC is lining up to pay $2.5 billion a year for 11 years for rights to broadcast some NBA games, they need to make good on that investment. As subscription revenue doesn't even come close to advertising revenue yet, that looks like asking advertisers for more money. If you ask the advertisers for more money, they need to pay for bigger talent and production value. If they need to pay for bigger talent, then they are more incentivized to go fishing in the A-list pond.\n\nAnd who is in the A-list pond? My hypothesis is that it is disproportionately more people that were famous 20 years ago, who were able to leverage the last vestiges of the American monocultural media diet into thriving internet and prestige film/television careers. To the end user, you, this means more Peyton Manning, more McConaughey, more Jennifer Garner, more of 2005's best.\n\nIn short: It is easier to sign bigger checks for known entities than it is for even marginally risky players.\n\nThis, I think, even partially accounts for current reactionary stifling of the Me Too movement. Alongside rapid \"conservatization\" of the American public, there is at least a surface level appearance of sweeping new allegations under the rug. After all, the entertainment and advertising industries that got burned on public sentiment moving against longtime mass-market-appealing-personalities-and-predators like Kevin Spacey or James Franco do not want to see the same things happen to people for whom they have since invested enormous sums, like Snoop Dogg or Casey Affleck. Both of whom have had lawsuits launched against them for sexual assault and both of whom featured prominently in Super Bowl commercials this year. In order for your risk averse investments to return, you have to see to it that your A-listers remain your A-listers.\n\nIn conclusion, despite the growth of the populace of individuals paid for their personality and creative labor, the distribution of these dollars appears to be entrenching itself further in an establishment that formed 20-25 years ago. In the end, what this will mean for culture is tough to predict, although I believe we are already beginning to see a reactionary \"flattening\" of popular media as investment dollars and corporate willpower for diversity dry up. We will still get invention and innovation, but I think that this media environment will not amplify novelty in the ways 2005-2025 might've.\n\nAfter all this, though, they need us to keep watching and to keep spending. And if the product ain't good? Well, maybe the pendulum will swing back.\n\nThat's all for today. Thanks for reading.\n\nI haven't done this before, but I am going to make public my Venmo handle, which is @Alex-Schneidman. Writing Arachne has been and will continue to be one of my favorite things that I do, and thanks to the privileges and resources I have, I am okay while I am unemployed. But if you'd like to support the work I do monetarily, I would sincerely appreciate it. If not, thanks for even reading to the bottom of this entry. That in itself is a kindness that I greatly appreciate.","feature_image":"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2025/02/original.png","featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","email_recipient_filter":"all","created_at":"2025-02-19T18:14:14.000Z","updated_at":"2025-02-20T13:16:00.000Z","published_at":"2025-02-20T13:15:55.000Z","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null,"newsletter_id":"66f029f981a59700086b0e28","show_title_and_feature_image":1},{"id":"67c5dfac2f2c680001558fec","uuid":"4b2e3e19-9625-46d1-8a8e-8605644779bb","title":"Impressions: Vibecoding","slug":"impressions-vibecoding","mobiledoc":null,"lexical":"{\"root\":{\"children\":[{\"children\":[{\"detail\":0,\"format\":0,\"mode\":\"normal\",\"style\":\"\",\"text\":\"For all of my tech curiosity and the DIY spirit I cultivate around my digital life, I have no idea how to code.

Ironically, America's unceasing consumerism and profit incentive and China's logistical ability to meet these demands have increased the economic prosperity of both countries, creating this sort of frenemies dynamic where they don't really like each other, but they also can't just leave each other. But recent developments, including advances in China-based consumer electronics, automobiles, and AI, and a frantically employed \"America First\" agenda from the new federal order, could serve to disrupt the lock step dance. We may be entering into a transformational new period. What have we seen, what can we see from here, and what will it all mean?\n\nImplicit to all of my writing is a sincere, deeply held belief: people are not their governments. It is one of the foundational human-first principles I attempt to live by, and through which I make my analysis. I am an anti-nationalist. I want to be clear that the modern Chinese government has engaged and continues to engage in, to name a few examples off the dome, genocide/ethnic cleansing, censorship, imperialist expansionism, threats to dissidents and journalists, election interference, torture, and forced labor. None of the following statements made are in any way an endorsement of the actions of a totalitarian, surveillance state. I am simply seeking to make important observations about where things stand and where things could go.\n\nAlong those lines, I also have no interest in exempting the American federal government and its current round table of oligarchs from its own complicity in genocide/ethnic cleansing, censorship, imperialist expansionism, etc. I am not on the side of the United States or the CCP. I am on the side of regular-ass people just attempting to live healthy, fulfilled lives with their friends and families, no matter where they happen to have been born.\n\nNow let's talk tech.\n\nUS reluctance to promote healthy competition and fund meaningful innovation could cause the country to lose influence in three key technological spaces: electric vehicles, AI, and consumer electronics. Here's some evidence for China's growing influence in tech.\n\n\nEVs\n\nBecause of significant CCP investment, control of important metals for production, low labor costs, and the development of a middle class, China's EV market is exploding.

Sitting at around 21% in China, Apple is the only non-Chinese company even in the top 7 for smartphone market share. Apple also recently broke into the top 5 in India. But this is just on the consumer side. According to public reports, of the nearly 200 Apple manufacturing suppliers, around 150 of them have primary facilities in China. The same reports show a slight uptick in Apple's Indian manufacturing presence as well.\n\nMonopolistic hold on developers\n\nThere are basically two games in town for mobile app developers, Apple and Google. Via proprietary protocols and restrictive purchasing policies, Apple's hold on the mobile development space is extremely secure. Apple could not sell a single device the rest of this year and just coast on the money it makes from the App Store.\n\nWalled garden\n\nReports of Apple's demise often overlook the basic fact that close to 60% of American smartphone owners have iPhones. Those people don't all suddenly choose a new phone, let alone an Android. Apple's software ecosystem is extremely powerful, and makes the idea of switching to a new platform something of a non-starter for many people. And this is all without significant Apple Intelligence features.\n\nPositive optics\n\nDespite the uproar about some of the advertising and amongst investors, Apple still holds a generally favorable view among the US population. Apple still ranks highest in customer satisfaction for its computers, and is regularly toward the top of the list of most admired employers. Apple was also one of a handful of companies to reject bad faith challenges to their existing DEI programs. While the r/degoogle subreddit, a place for people to share tips on how to scrub Google products from their lives, has 258k community members, r/deapple only has 2.5k.\n\nSo I am wary of the reports of Apple's demise. While, yes, the Siri delay is a profound embarrassment to an otherwise sure footed company and brand, I don't believe it foretells the downfall of this company, or even a crisis of leadership at the top. We'll see what happens at this year's WWDC and with this year's iPhone, but I don't think Apple is going anywhere.","feature_image":"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1611262588019-db6cc2032da3?crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&fit=max&fm=jpg&ixid=M3wxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDd8fGFwcGxlJTIwY29tcHV0ZXJ8ZW58MHx8fHwxNzQyMzEzNDQ1fDA&ixlib=rb-4.0.3&q=80&w=2000","featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","email_recipient_filter":"all","created_at":"2025-03-18T15:57:16.000Z","updated_at":"2025-03-18T15:58:46.000Z","published_at":"2025-03-18T15:58:46.000Z","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null,"newsletter_id":"66f029f981a59700086b0e28","show_title_and_feature_image":1},{"id":"67e30fc11cd1de0001c215b8","uuid":"12f0f8f7-6e25-43af-aca1-f3b7bc9c4ab6","title":"New phone, Houthis?","slug":"new-phone-houthis","mobiledoc":null,"lexical":"{\"root\":{\"children\":[{\"children\":[{\"detail\":0,\"format\":0,\"mode\":\"normal\",\"style\":\"\",\"text\":\"Yesterday, \",\"type\":\"extended-text\",\"version\":1},{\"detail\":0,\"format\":2,\"mode\":\"normal\",\"style\":\"\",\"text\":\"The Atlantic\",\"type\":\"extended-text\",\"version\":1},{\"detail\":0,\"format\":0,\"mode\":\"normal\",\"style\":\"\",\"text\":\" published an article.

While the likely main cause of this was her mistaken approach to the Midwest (which is to say, her <em>absent</em> approach to the Midwest), there is incontrovertible evidence that Comey's investigation and the ensuing media firestorm confirmed preexisting biases about Hillary's competence, crookedness, and coldness, and drew voters away from her.</p><p>I'm not here to relitigate Hillary's emails (although if you want to, take a listen to <a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/ca/podcast/the-clinton-email-scandal/id1651876897?i=1000627803750\">this If Books Could Kill episode</a>).

Note the section I highlighted which comprises the extent of the above the fold recognition the Signal group chat story got.\n\nI don't have much hope that this story will get the attention it deserves. Without that attention, the Democrats won't face pressure to call for resignations. Without that attention, the Republicans are given tacit approval to continue fucking up. \"We promise we won't care enough to make you act any differently,\" we might be saying to them.\n\nWhile this story demonstrates and supports the case for incompetence across the board, its implications are far reaching, and our continued failure to hold the powerful accountable has already landed us in this fraught moment. If planes can fall out of the sky, if \"let them get Bird Flu\" is the official position of the feds, if war plans can get sent around a group chat, and there isn't meaningful pushback, it just allows them to keep doing what they are doing.\n\nWhat happens next feels pretty obvious. This story gets normalized, makes the opposition complacent, and forgotten as a minor weekend mishap. Some Democrats call for resignations, others don't, citing their self-satisfied commitment to working with the rot across the aisle. And the rest of us just wait as the floodwaters circle the drain, upvoting Luigi's letters from prison or sipping from paper straws until the world we could've had is too irretrievable to pull from our hope.","feature_image":"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2025/03/waltzmike_hegsethpete_AP_c561ee.jpg","featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","email_recipient_filter":"all","created_at":"2025-03-25T20:19:13.000Z","updated_at":"2025-03-25T20:25:00.000Z","published_at":"2025-03-25T20:25:00.000Z","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null,"newsletter_id":"66f029f981a59700086b0e28","show_title_and_feature_image":1},{"id":"67e5cb918606450001ba67db","uuid":"0b51a114-40ed-4c0d-afeb-373e51630603","title":"You Are Being Lied To","slug":"you-are-being-lied-to","mobiledoc":null,"lexical":"{\"root\":{\"children\":[{\"children\":[{\"detail\":0,\"format\":0,\"mode\":\"normal\",\"style\":\"\",\"text\":\"At the September 10th presidential debate, when pressed about Project 2025, Trump said the following:\",\"type\":\"extended-text\",\"version\":1}],\"direction\":\"ltr\",\"format\":\"\",\"indent\":0,\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"version\":1},{\"children\":[{\"detail\":0,\"format\":0,\"mode\":\"normal\",\"style\":\"\",\"text\":\"I haven’t read it.

And when these lies are done on Fox News, amongst the nation's friendliest platforms for psycho right wing stuff, the lies gain reach and the polish of expensive broadcast.\n\nYou can spot these types of lies when something so readily obvious has happened that makes someone look bad, but they march out on TV and start talking about Marxism or whatever.\n\nLies to confirm bias\n\nLet's say you want to convince people, but especially those who already agree with you, that the government is spending ludicrous sums of money on frivolous stuff. Why would you want to do this? Maybe you want the government to just give you money. Maybe you want to really stick it to your political foes. Maybe you want to centralize the power of the president.\n\nSo you start calling all federal civil servants lazy, you start claiming that the US government is spending 50 million dollars to send condoms to Gaza.\n\nThese kinds of lies are not meant to convince anyone who doesn't want the government to be chainsawed. They are meant to validate the already held beliefs of the people who do. They are simply there to fuel the self righteous convictions of the already powerful and of the people who gave them power. And when questioned, they put up a man made of straw and discharge the smarmiest little \"Oh, so you don't want the government to be efficient?\"\n\nConfirmation bias is amongst the most powerful forces that entrenches regressive ideologies. While so often it is framed as the tendency of people to only seek out or internalize new information, it rarely is characterized as the tendency of people to internalize disinformation.\n\nLies to retain power\n\nThe kinds of lies the powerful tell to retain their status is correlated to how they view their responsibility to society. And this is not just limited to politics.\n\nHere's an example.\n\nWhen Mark Zuckerberg announced the changes Meta was making to its content moderation approach, the first lines of his statement went as follows:\n\nHey everyone. I want to talk about something important today because it's time to get back to our roots around free expression on Facebook and Instagram. I started building social media to give people a voice.\n\nAs many people pointed out, the \"roots\" of Facebook are a basic \"hot or not\" game Zuck made for his puerile friends at Harvard. When Facebook started, there was no news feed, there were no recommendation algorithms, thus there was no real \"voice\" he was giving people.\n\nThe framing here, when set alongside his apology before Congress in 2019 for failing to adequately moderate content on his platforms, gives the impression that at one point or the other, Zuck was lying. Which one doesn't even really matter to me.\n\nWhat's evident is that Zuck is just crafting a narrative, building a framework around which his decision making can be validated and his company can remain extremely, world fracturingly powerful.\n\nAt the most cynical, Zuck doesn't feel he has any responsibility to society. Why else would he build apocalypse bunkers on the land he bought in Hawaii? At the least, he genuinely feels that without Meta the world is worse off. But is it that the world is worse off, or Mark is?\n\nThis is what I mean about the lies that the powerful will tell to retain their power. I believe, often to a fault, that you should say and do things with conviction, that you should have a thoughtfully constructed way to look at the world. But, as a society, we view being powerful as better than being honest. If you have to construct some false narrative to curry favor with a president or appease stockholders, you do it, because that is where the power lies.\n\nIf you see your power as something you are owed, as something endowed in you by the righteous and the similarly powerful, you will go to great lengths, even gasp lying about what you truly believe to retain your power.\n\nBut what do they really think?\n\nAt the end of the day, it does not make a difference. Whether Donald Trump actually believes that babies are being aborted at 9 months is simply not relevant. A lie like that one is there to make it seem like to even debate the topic is ridiculous, to confirm what his supporters believe, and to signal to his boosters that he will make stupendously far-fetched claims to ensure that its their side that gets the crown and sceptre. To do any sort of forensics to discover what a liar actually believes is a failed errand.\n\nLook, instead, to what they are trying to achieve by lying. Yes, obviously they are trying to control a narrative. But what narrative? Who is their audience? To what end?\n\nThe most important thing I want to get at is that all messaging, inclusive of lies, is done with an intent. Marketing, storytelling, rhetoric, these are more powerful tools to engender support and attention than any weapon. Whether that intent is to retain power, persuade people, or stoke an emotion, all messaging serves a purpose.\n\nDespite the open antagonism and aggrieved skepticism I have for the right, building your own framework for understanding the world is actually politically neutral. I have found that peeling back the intent behind actions, not just the actions themselves, bolsters my ability to land on what is actually important.","feature_image":"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1520811163141-295270e34c12?crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&fit=max&fm=jpg&ixid=M3wxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDMzfHxzaGVlcHxlbnwwfHx8fDE3NDMxMTMzMjd8MA&ixlib=rb-4.0.3&q=80&w=2000","featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","email_recipient_filter":"all","created_at":"2025-03-27T22:05:05.000Z","updated_at":"2025-03-27T22:10:03.000Z","published_at":"2025-03-27T22:10:03.000Z","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null,"newsletter_id":"66f029f981a59700086b0e28","show_title_and_feature_image":1},{"id":"67f33fbbf487040001fdf70d","uuid":"67d26a24-6b37-49e7-9ae9-da5def5c41d8","title":"As Shaky As A Fiddler On The Roof","slug":"as-shaky-as-a-fiddler-on-the-roof","mobiledoc":null,"lexical":"{\"root\":{\"children\":[{\"children\":[{\"detail\":0,\"format\":0,\"mode\":\"normal\",\"style\":\"\",\"text\":\"While I don't write about it extremely often, theatre preoccupies my mind.

For most of my life, even since I stopped performing, I have been around theatre people, rehearsing, attending shows, and talking in bar booths about it. For a number of reasons, I worry about the future of this art form. More on that another time.\n\nFor right now, I want to talk about how current events may have direct downstream impacts on the epicenter of the theatrical world, Broadway. While I am all for disentangling what is thought of as \"theatre\" from Broadway's conception of it, Broadway is the flagship behind which every sincere high school production, every community theatre revue, and every cabaret show trails. We'd be worse off without the engine of creativity, talent, and invention done within a few blocks in New York City. So, while tariffs kick in and Americans are shipped off to Salvadoran gulags, here are a few ways of looking at Broadway in the context of our present moment. In short, it's not great.\n\n\nTourism\n\nAccording to The Broadway League's data from the 2023-2024, around 66% of Broadway-goers were tourists. Breaking out further, that's 45% from areas of the US beyond the NY metropolitan area and 21% internationally. Last year, that 21% accounted for 2.62 million tickets sold. As Playbill.com puts it, this \"is the second highest total in three decades, no doubt part of New York City's continued success in tourism recovery.\"\n\nYou see this word a lot, \"recovery.\" Of course, Broadway was kneecapped by the pandemic, and there were real and sincere fears that it might never recover. The data shows that the industry is bouncing back, even storming back in ways. But there is a risk of this coming undone.\n\nHere is US tourism data from analyst Jeff Asher.\n\nPlaying around with CBP airport processing data this morning to see how much air travel by non-US passengers is cratering.\n\n— Jeff Asher (@jeffasher.bsky.social) 2025-04-05T13:16:44.026Z\n\nWhile this chart aggregates data from a few key international airports, let's zero in on New York's JFK. Between March 15 and April 3, 2024 and 2025, JFK saw a drop in international travelers of -16.6%. In other words, 16.6% fewer international travelers came through JFK between 3/15 and 4/3 in 2025 than in 2024.\n\nWhat might account for this? There are plenty of things one can point to, including the current administration's antagonism toward other countries, fears about measles, and the increased prices brought on by tariffs. But in general, this is very bad news, with ramifications beyond just Broadway.\n\nData is still being reported, and of course it is extremely early, but in an industry that relies on international tourists for a fifth of its revenue, any dramatic decline in travel eats at already slim margins.\n\n\nTariffs\n\nI don't want to just wave a hand and broadly say that tariffs are bad for Broadway. They are bad for everyone and everything! Everything gets more expensive! But I think that there are key ways in which tariffs effect Broadway in particular.\n\nFirst, there are the costs of production. If you've spent time amongst theatre people, you'll know that a strong characteristic of us is a kind of thriftiness. Personally, I have worn costumes that sat for years in storage before landing on my back instead of being bought new. But sets need to be built, costumes need to be mended, laundry needs to be run, Playbills need to be printed. Impending tariffs threaten the supply chains of all of the consumable products often used in a Broadway house. While there are goods that are reused and repurposed, there are always new things bought for a show, often things that are used up, and these things will come under the influence of tariffs. Whether the lumber comes from Canada, the fabric comes from Bangladesh, or the computers are built in Vietnam, Broadway is not uniquely positioned to absorb these rising costs. In fact, the margins are so thin on Broadway that they are uniquely positioned to suffer from these rising costs. Will these mean even further increased ticket prices? Will it mean cheaper, corners-cut productions?\n\nSecond, there are the indirect economies reliant on Broadway that will be effected by the tariffs. While Times Square certainly ain't going anywhere, the rising costs of doing business may deter locals and tourists alike from engaging with the area synonymous with Broadway.\n\nThe tariffs are bad and dumb, and they will make everything worse. Broadway is not a business that can easily respond to disruption.\n\n\nImmigration\n\nThe fascist authoritarian regime disappearing people off the streets is inherently at odds with an industry historically reliant upon immigrant, working class, and politically progressive constituents. While there are ambient characteristics of the government's approach to immigration that may anger theatre people, it is the direct, serious impacts that our racist, isolationist nationalism will have that pose immediate risk to how Broadway functions.\n\nTheatre, like many art forms, is victoriously global. Globalism is frequently an inherent aspect of how theatre is studied, created, and produced. Think here of Julie Taymor's tutelage under Indonesian puppeteers that inspired her approach to The Lion King. Think of the 17 Jean Valjean's that sang at the 10th Anniversary show of Les Mis in 1995. Think of Maybe Happy Ending, the Broadway Show Of The Moment, an international show transplanted from South Korea.\n\nBroadway requires artists who often work on short term visas or who often emigrate from dire circumstances. Under a regime intent on questioning the motives of every single immigrant to this country, both legal and sublegal, both citizen and non-citizen, Broadway will suffer from the same kind of brain drain that universities are already experiencing. Just as graduate students and professors are being asked by their universities not to leave the country for fear that they don't know that they could come back, Broadway's handful of international artists may too be met with numerous obstacles.\n\nIn spite of cringe, Lin-Manuel was correct in writing \"Immigrants, [they] get the job done.\" New York's entire cultural cache is downstream of Jewish, Dominican, Puerto Rican immigrants, to name a few. Under a more restricted federal government, Broadway will suffer.\n\nThere are a couple of other ways I just want to hit on that Broadway may be at risk during a Trump presidency. I don't mean to be too speculative, but I just want to offer a few things that individuals and organizations can build resilience to.\n\nDespite the way that the pandemic destroyed indoor events like Broadway, there is little evidence left at the theatre that this was ever a concern. Masking is certainly not normalized, and the encouragement not to see a show if you are sick is not as much in the foreground as it was before. I am not necessarily saying that Broadway needs to continue to act like there is a pandemic happening (although we certainly all should be masking more), but I am saying that the greatest evidence that the Trump administration will botch the next pandemic is that they botched the first one. Other great evidence includes the grifter-clowns he's got running the show. Even if the administration dismisses the threat of disease, like they did last time, Broadway needs to be prepared for what could happen if New York faces another health crisis.

And generally, things that are bad for New York City are bad for Broadway, though in more oblique ways.\n\nIt is a goal of mine to make personal the often difficult to personalize. It can be easy to sift through headlines and feel a sense ofuneasy detachment, even for things that ostensibly effect you. I find sometimes that I defensively construct this detachment by over intellectualizing.\n\nBut in every way that we interact with the world, there are downstream effects of the choices made by irresponsible people in power.

When I wrote a few weeks ago about deleting my Facebook account, I did not mention that I had also created a completely blank burner account. As a person invested in and often researching communication technology, I feel it's important to keep a door open to see what's going on over there.\n\nWith unending genuflection to an authoritarian in the White House and general cowardice, Facebook has allowed droves and droves of garbage to flood its site. Since creating this blank account - no friends, no likes, just vibes - I have observed first hand some of the most bizarre and unsettling content I have ever seen.\n\nAI generated non-consensual material of Billie Eilish, completely manufactured news stories with tens of thousands of likes, historical misinformation, and lots of skin. If you are a new user of Facebook and they aren't sure about you, they will feed you the most garish, sickening slop to keep you scrolling.\n\nSo today I wanted to share with you one of the things I've seen, why I think it exists, and what, if anything, we can do about it.\n\nAn anatomy of spam\n\nHi, can I interest you in \"Animals & Pets\"? Our profile picture just says \"FUTURE DAY\" and we only post stories about Karoline Leavitt, Steph Curry, and Caitlin Clark.\n\nSo as you can see above, what we have here is a completely made up (likely AI generated) story that is attempting to valorize Karoline Leavitt, the current White House Press Secretary.\n\nNow, why would this exist? Who would make this?\n\nJust on the surface, when we see any media that attempts to characterize an otherwise controversial figure as noble we should be skeptical, even if its a puff piece about a horrible man in the New York Times. But this is obviously not the New York Times.\n\nWhen we open the comments we can click through to the \"article\" that this post is coming from.\n\nThe link redirects you.\n\n\"viralstoryus.noithatnhaxinhbacgiang.com\" is not a news source of which I am familiar.\n\nThis is deeply weird and unsettling, but under the surface lies incredibly simple mechanisms that allow spam and misinformation to flourish on sites like Facebook. Let's go down the pipeline here and see what we find.\n\nFacebook is a product that literally relies on attention. Without a subscription model or insane VC funding, it relies on advertising to keep the lights on. This is not news, and many people can understand that Facebook's whole MO is to track your behavior, segment you into a marketable group, and then push material - both paid and unpaid - straight to your eyeballs.\n\nQuick sidebar: What's the difference between \"spam\" and a \"scam\"? Spam is useless garbage that is mostly preying on your attention and the economies that thrive on it. A scam is maliciously targeted material designed to prey on your instincts in order to funnel money from you.\n\nOn the surface, what's happening here is spam, but it is definitely not innocuous.\n\nWhat happens when you optimize for attention? Opportunists like whoever is running \"viralstoryus\" flood the system with incendiary, bias-confirming material that keeps people clicking, liking, scrolling, and watching.\n\nBut why?\n\nWhy go through all this trouble to generate all this, why take up the mantle of zombie Facebook pages to post this garbage? How could this be helping anyone? Here are some answers:\n\nSEO scams\n\nEveryday, Google web crawlers are tracking where people on the internet are going. They use this data to upscale or downscale results in their search interface. Companies and media outlets will often attempt to game this system in order to drive traffic to their sites. This is why you will often see entire \"news\" headlines that just read \"What time do the Oscars start tonight?\" Outlets know that a lot of people will search these exact words, and they want to appear high in the search results to get people to click on their site to get people to look at their ads to make money.\n\nIn this particular case, there are no ads on the homepage, so that mechanism likely isn't in effect here. But if you look carefully you can see the full URL of the site \"viralstoryus.noithatnhaxinhbacgiang.com.\" Go to noithatnhaxinhbacgiang.com and you'll find a Vietnamese furniture store.\n\nWhat's possibly happening here is that this Vietnamese furniture store wants to drive traffic to its site via Google searches and other external links. By having a fraudulent news page up that gets thousands of Facebook interactions per post (and thus a lot of clickthrough), the furniture store gets a boost in Google's rankings. Google's algorithms see spikes in traffic to this domain and assumes \"Hm, I guess this is a site people want to see!\"\n\nTargeted misinformation\n\nFor years now, really since before the 2016 election, we know that foreign adversaries have seeded fake news and sown discord amongst Americans via Facebook. These efforts may have several downstream effects favorable to adversarial interests.\n\n * Creating political discord in the US\n * Distracting populations from more pressing societal concerns\n * Forming fraudulent \"in group\" cohesion\n * Sowing distrust in professionalized media\n\nThis can be observed in the inflammatory, click-baity, politicized content being distributed. Did Karoline Leavitt really go to her high school and raise funds for the retirement of her beloved janitor? Certainly not. A story like this seeks to confirm the biases of right leaning people looking to share material that further validates their support for the president.\n\nThis deeper entrenches political divides, as well as fractures an American sense of truth and reality. This, I don't think it is a stretch to say, bolsters the super powers that oppose us by making the American population slower, dumber, and so profoundly aggravated that nothing meaningful ever gets done.\n\nData harvesting\n\nEven without accepting site permissions or consenting to cookies, a useful batch of your data is tracked by practically every site you visit, especially when you're using Chrome.\n\nSites like my example may be parts of a pipeline that allows them to use your data in ways you may not appreciate. Even when the sites are tracking you without any personally identifiable information, they can be using reports of traffic sources and IP addresses to sell information to other brokers to then further target you and people like you.\n\nHow you can spot it\n\nWhenever I find a page that I am skeptical of for whatever reason, I scroll all the way to the bottom to try to find links to a Privacy Policy or Terms of Use. A legitimate webcrawler like Google will often downrank you for failing to have these pages, especially if you are (or are masquerading as) a news site. So scam/spam sites will often put fake Privacy Policy or Terms of Use pages up with generic language.\n\nOn a real Privacy Policy or Terms of Use page, you will see a lot of legalese and disclosures about data collection. But what you are looking for is an address and contact information. European and US State laws require data collectors to provide this information for users.\n\nLet's take a look at the contact information for \"viralstoryus.noithatnhaxinhbacgiang.com\"\n\n\nYes, that number is literally five five five, one two three, four five six seven.\n\nAnd when you go to that address in Google Maps you'll see a Truist bank in a supermarket parking lot.\n\nThese are immediate and significant hints that the site you are dealing with is not a serious outlet.\n\nThe AI of it all\n\nGurgling right under all of this is a foreboding slurry of AI nightmares.

If that's not your vibe, thanks for having read this far. But today I want to meditate on <em>responsibility</em>. While there is a broad history of thinking about what we owe each other, I want to write specifically about how analyzing responsibility (i.e. what we owe each other, what we owe ourselves, what we owe the Earth, what we owe God, etc.) can offer a path for those of us struggling with the gleeful cruelty, stupendous shortsightedness, and pathetic cowardice exhibited by the powerful right now. So here's what I got.</p><h4 id=\"starting-with-why\">Starting with \"Why\"</h4><p>One of the most popular TED Talks of all time is <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp0HIF3SfI4\">Simon Sinek's \"Start With Why\"</a> presentation. Over the years, Sinek has become something of a figure in left-of-center intellectualism, owed to the fact that his ideas have found attentive ears amongst the corporate liberal space.</p><p>The crux of his framework is as follows: Everyone, from businesses to great leaders, know <em>what</em> they do. Most of those constituents know <em>how</em> they do it. But it is the particularly great marketers, the particularly great leaders, who not only know <em>why</em> they do something, but they start with that purpose. For his marketing/business audience he puts it this way:</p><div class=\"kg-card kg-callout-card kg-callout-card-blue\"><div class=\"kg-callout-emoji\">💬</div><div class=\"kg-callout-text\">\"People don't buy what you do, they buy why you do it.\"</div></div><p>I have always been compelled by this framework, and have been drawn to mission driven organizations ever since because of it. I believe that when you really know <em>why</em> you want to do something, beyond just for money, the how and the what become extraordinarily clear.</p><p>While Sinek casts aside money as a \"result\" and therefore <em>not</em> a powerful \"why,\" I believe it would be naive to neglect the incentive structures in place that make \"because I want money\" a common and formidable why. The incentives in place to amass wealth, notoriety, and power have massively outpaced the appeal of more positive, pro-social whys. And sure, I am relying on anecdotal observations of the playing field, but I don't think it is a stretch to say that being a genocidal, belligerent, snickering loser has become extremely rewarding.</p><p>I have started assessing the whys, both stated and implied, of the powerful, and in doing so I can imagine a path to the better world. So today I want to show you a few examples of what I mean.</p><h4 id=\"the-grey-lady\">The Grey Lady</h4><p>What is The New York Times for? Who do they serve?

To be completely transparent, I have found it extremely difficult to write recently. Across tech, media, and democracy - the three primary verticals of this newsletter - the news has been very bad. I want the things I write here to be encouraging, thoughtful, and pro-social, and I found myself beginning drafts that turned into incendiary screeds. Amidst the sadism and defiantly anti-social behavior of a few of the world's most cretinous losers, I have found myself seeking out frameworks, media, anything I can get my hands on to remind me of what I wrote for this newsletter on January 23 of this year: People have always cared.\n\nMiscellaneous Reminders About the FutureI really do not love Arachne being a place where I dreamscape the world we will inherit. I think that there are a number of flaws around the process of prediction in general, and there is no reason to believe that we can project out, say, ten years with anyarachneAlex Schneidman\n\nJust as past posts have tipped in the philosophical direction, so will this one. If that's not your vibe, thanks for having read this far. But today I want to meditate on responsibility. While there is a broad history of thinking about what we owe each other, I want to write specifically about how analyzing responsibility (i.e. what we owe each other, what we owe ourselves, what we owe the Earth, what we owe God, etc.) can offer a path for those of us struggling with the gleeful cruelty, stupendous shortsightedness, and pathetic cowardice exhibited by the powerful right now. So here's what I got.\n\nStarting with \"Why\"\n\nOne of the most popular TED Talks of all time is Simon Sinek's \"Start With Why\" presentation. Over the years, Sinek has become something of a figure in left-of-center intellectualism, owed to the fact that his ideas have found attentive ears amongst the corporate liberal space.\n\nThe crux of his framework is as follows: Everyone, from businesses to great leaders, know what they do. Most of those constituents know how they do it. But it is the particularly great marketers, the particularly great leaders, who not only know why they do something, but they start with that purpose. For his marketing/business audience he puts it this way:\n\n💬\"People don't buy what you do, they buy why you do it.\"\n\nI have always been compelled by this framework, and have been drawn to mission driven organizations ever since because of it. I believe that when you really know why you want to do something, beyond just for money, the how and the what become extraordinarily clear.\n\nWhile Sinek casts aside money as a \"result\" and therefore not a powerful \"why,\" I believe it would be naive to neglect the incentive structures in place that make \"because I want money\" a common and formidable why. The incentives in place to amass wealth, notoriety, and power have massively outpaced the appeal of more positive, pro-social whys. And sure, I am relying on anecdotal observations of the playing field, but I don't think it is a stretch to say that being a genocidal, belligerent, snickering loser has become extremely rewarding.\n\nI have started assessing the whys, both stated and implied, of the powerful, and in doing so I can imagine a path to the better world. So today I want to show you a few examples of what I mean.\n\nThe Grey Lady\n\nWhat is The New York Times for? Who do they serve? What is their responsibility as an institution? They'll tell you:\n\nThis is the homepage of nytco.com, the online home for the company. If you want to learn more about their company, apply for a job, invest, this is what they want you to know.\n\nSo if I have them correct, they feel a sense of internal responsibility to 1. seek the truth and 2. help people understand the world.\n\nAre they fulfilling this responsibility?\n\nThis past week news spread about a $400 million jumbo jet that Trump is set to receive as a gift from the Qatari government.

Kennedy and Johnson misused it to target conservative media in the 60s. That's bad!\n\nWhy we got here\n\nThe shortest possible answer I can give you is one keystroke: $. The deregulation of the fairness doctrine, the proliferation of cable, and the expansion of the internet offered entirely new frontiers for big business to capitalize. The influx of advertising and subscriber dollars, as well as the investment of boom time 80s money lenders, exploded the media industries. Whereas under the fairness doctrine, news was meant to be a public utility and its broadcasters limited in their ability to editorialize, now the news was a product that could be bought and sold. In the mid-90s there were enough dollars and eyeballs in the ecosystem to support multiple 24 hour news channels.\n\nMeanwhile, print media begins a long slog to irrelevance once AOL brings more and more people to a digital news environment. Since the internet was mostly able to become ubiquitous without much intervention, companies like Google and Facebook were able to capture control of the advertising experience, the money faucet that makes the whole consumer internet possible.\n\nUnder a model in which individual consumers are responsible for funding the media they consume - either with their attention or with their dollars - the civic sense of responsibility to provide the public with quality reporting and journalism eroded. It has eroded so much that Sesame Street, once America's greatest public broadcasting success story, can barely find a home for people to watch it.\n\nThere was never a time in which American news and media was free from corporate interests, and frankly I'm not even advocating for one that is. But the environment we have now is so consolidated around certain priorities that multiple elected officials and their families can be doxxed, shot, or hammered in the head and the beat just goes on.\n\nWhere to go from here\n\nIn Part II of this piece I want to offer some specific tips for how you can both adjust your news consumption to be more civic minded and encourage others to do so. For now, here's some general thoughts.\n\nThe Trump administration has already created such an environment of fear amongst the largest media players that they are willing to shirk integrity that, in some cases, they have built up for decades + a few million dollars in exchange for reduced antitrust scrutiny and a con man's promise he won't sue you. As demonstrated by the missteps of outlets like the New York Times, the Washington Post, or the LA Times and of platforms like Google, TikTok, and Twitter, real change here will not come from the top. The future of how you individually and all of us collectively get our news must come from a decentralized, citizen-led effort. More on that in the next piece.\n\nIn the future I am fighting for we are all more literate and more civic minded. As many variables as there are in play, I sincerely believe that a groundswell of thoughtful people can shift how the attention getters are received in our media ecosystem. As I've written before, they need us to make the whole thing work.\n\nWe have to believe in a better version of what we've got.","feature_image":"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1503694978374-8a2fa686963a?crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&fit=max&fm=jpg&ixid=M3wxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDh8fG5ld3N8ZW58MHx8fHwxNzUyMDE5MjY4fDA&ixlib=rb-4.1.0&q=80&w=2000","featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","email_recipient_filter":"all","created_at":"2025-07-09T22:31:22.000Z","updated_at":"2025-07-09T22:33:17.000Z","published_at":"2025-07-09T22:33:17.000Z","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null,"newsletter_id":"66f029f981a59700086b0e28","show_title_and_feature_image":1},{"id":"68755013bf640c0001f13239","uuid":"4a5a338e-e39a-4ac2-8ceb-1df89d98411a","title":"There's Good News and Bad News, Part II","slug":"theres-good-news-and-bad-news-part-ii","mobiledoc":null,"lexical":"{\"root\":{\"children\":[{\"children\":[{\"detail\":0,\"format\":0,\"mode\":\"normal\",\"style\":\"\",\"text\":\"This is a follow up piece to a post I published last week. \",\"type\":\"extended-text\",\"version\":1},{\"children\":[{\"detail\":0,\"format\":0,\"mode\":\"normal\",\"style\":\"\",\"text\":\"Make sure you check that out here!\",\"type\":\"extended-text\",\"version\":1}],\"direction\":\"ltr\",\"format\":\"\",\"indent\":0,\"type\":\"link\",\"version\":1,\"rel\":null,\"target\":null,\"title\":null,\"url\":\"__GHOST_URL__/theres-good-news-and-bad-news-part-i/\"}],\"direction\":\"ltr\",\"format\":\"\",\"indent\":0,\"type\":\"extended-heading\",\"version\":1,\"tag\":\"h2\"},{\"children\":[{\"detail\":0,\"format\":0,\"mode\":\"normal\",\"style\":\"\",\"text\":\"Part I went over how the economic incentives of the news industries create an imbalance between what \",\"type\":\"extended-text\",\"version\":1},{\"detail\":0,\"format\":2,\"mode\":\"normal\",\"style\":\"\",\"text\":\"gets\",\"type\":\"extended-text\",\"version\":1},{\"detail\":0,\"format\":0,\"mode\":\"normal\",\"style\":\"\",\"text\":\" attention and what \",\"type\":\"extended-text\",\"version\":1},{\"detail\":0,\"format\":2,\"mode\":\"normal\",\"style\":\"\",\"text\":\"deserves\",\"type\":\"extended-text\",\"version\":1},{\"detail\":0,\"format\":0,\"mode\":\"normal\",\"style\":\"\",\"text\":\" attention.

Great. Now let's talk about what you can do about it. Here are five suggestions for adjusting your news diet.</p><h3 id=\"individuals-brands\">Individuals &gt; Brands</h3><p>You've probably seen a chart that purports to map the political biases of news organizations. Here's an example of one:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-14-at-2.45.25---PM.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1138\" srcset=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-14-at-2.45.25---PM.png 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1000/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-14-at-2.45.25---PM.png 1000w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1600/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-14-at-2.45.25---PM.png 1600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-14-at-2.45.25---PM.png 2394w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><p><a href=\"https://app.adfontesmedia.com/chart/interactive?utm_source=adfontesmedia&amp;utm_medium=website\">Chart source</a></p><p>I don't love these charts. I find it very easy for insincere commentators to look at this and \"both sides\" the hell out of it. \"See! There's extremist conspiracists on both sides!\" But this chart lacks a third axis for influence.</p><p>Another thing that rubs me the wrong way about a chart like this is that, for example, it puts The New York Times as ideologically to the left of NPR and Al Jazeera. I don't need to get into it right now, but that's, uh, kinda wild. There may be individual people at these outlets who align this way, but the institutions on the whole are harder to pin down.</p><p>I worry that people come to align with a brand - MSNBC, Fox News, The New Yorker - and not with the individuals who produce work for those brands. Despite the best efforts of editors and producers, the quality of work put out by an outlet can vary widely between different individual people. An opinion piece in the Times written by Jamelle Bouie is very different from a piece by Bret Stephens.</p><p>What I am trying to stress here is that it is good to find <em>individuals</em> you trust over <em>companies</em> you trust. Doing this allows you to disentangle your news from sides, teams, and in-groups. There is nothing inherently wrong with being on a \"side,\" but aligning oneself internally to the specific ideas of specific people will fight back against the confirmation bias and groupthink that comes from being in an in-group.</p><p>One practical way of doing this is by finding work you enjoy and then finding the creator on social media. Often, you'll find that they have collaborated or uplifted the work of others. This can even come in the form of retweets! Sometimes retweets <em>are</em> endorsements!</p><p>Here are some specific people I love following, reading, and watching separate from the companies they may work for: Jon Bois, Jamelle Bouie, Harry Brewis (Hbomberguy), Kashana Cauley, Dana El Kurd, Becca Farsace, Aubrey Gordon, Hank Green, Megan Greenwell, Derek Guy (dieworkwear), Chris Hayes, Michael Hobbes, Marisa Kabas, Mina Kimes, Osita Nwanevu, Jenny Odell, John Oliver, Peter Shamshiri, Olúfẹ́mi O. Táíwò, Jillian C. York.</p><h3 id=\"understand-the-platform\">Understand the platform</h3><p>The difference between a news outlet and a news aggregator is a bit blurrier than it used to be, but I want to use the term \"platform\" here to describe the way you get news.</p><p>So what's a platform? A platform is a place through which you receive the content of your news. So television is a platform. TikTok, YouTube, Twitter, and Reddit are platforms. An old school RSS feeds are a platform. Your podcast app, Google News, Apple News, Instagram, Substack, email newsletters. Even more broadly, your phone is a platform. The platform is not <em>what</em> you're reading/watching/hearing but <em>where</em> and <em>how</em>.</p><p>Importantly, platforms often come with their own business models. Linear TV is mostly advertiser funded. Podcasts are mostly advertiser funded with a bit of audience funding. The social media sites are predominantly advertiser funded. Streaming is mostly subscriber funded but increasingly advertiser funded. Email newsletters are most often subscriber funded. And I probably don't need to tell you how your phone ended up in your pocket or your TV against the wall.</p><p>All of these business models come with their own baggage. In exchange for high levels of funding for professionalized producers, advertisers require loads of data and (occasionally) some editorial input. In exchange for personalization and community, podcasts and email newsletters ask for more than just the attention of their audiences.</p><p>Knowing how the platform you get your news makes money is key to understanding what stories get told on it.</p><p>Here are some platforms I use to get my news: Bluesky, Reddit, Apple News, Techmeme, Mediagazer.</p><h3 id=\"how-do-you-solve-a-problem-like-jeff-bezos\">How do you solve a problem like Jeff Bezos?</h3><p>It's simple, really. Cancel your WaPo subscription.</p><p>Following his intrusion on the editorial independence of the opinion writers at his newspaper, a movement started to boycott the Washington Post. Since he nixed the Kamala endorsement in 2024, other actions such as opening up the paper to AI have inspired further cancellations. I am fully aware that the <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/02/28/nx-s1-5312819/washington-post-bezos-subscriptions-cancellations\">estimated 12%</a> hit that WaPo got in subscribers means very little to the bottom line of a man like Jeff Bezos. Imagine each word in this newsletter represents a million dollars, so that the word \"There's\" in the title represented the first million dollars of Jeff's wealth. When you read the word at the end of this sentence, you'll have hit one billion dollars.</p><p>Bezos bought the Post for everything written before \"1. Individuals &gt; Brands.\"</p><p>According to Forbes, his personal wealth would be tallied up by your eyes reading and rereading what you've read so far around 238 times.</p><p>Thus, the Post represents a vanity project for Jeff, who pushed around its editorial board not because he thought it's what audiences wanted, but because he is a self interested person. We are all self interested people, but not all of us have one of the most storied and highly regarded news outlets in the world to tip the scales for us.</p><p>This is a story just about Jeff, but there are multiple outlets and platforms that are under the influence of whiny crybaby billionaires who, despite offering very little for the labor who make their companies possible, despite offering very little for the planet's resources they are burning, insist that we all agree with them and thank them for sending our pop stars to the edge of space or eroding the good will generated by USAID.</p><p>While the legacy media institutions are still valuable for their global reach and ability to report facts on the ground, their role as analysts or truth-to-power speakers is profoundly compromised by the likes of Bezos, Trump, Musk, or Murdoch. I do my best to stay away from them and their subsidiaries as much as possible.</p><h3 id=\"invest-in-independent-non-profit-and-cooperatively-owned-outlets\">Invest in independent, non-profit, and cooperatively owned outlets</h3><p>The most effective balm against news that is curdled with corporate interest exists. It comes in the form of smaller organizations whose incentive structures are not directly reliant on the mechanisms of the attention economy. There is an entire class of these types of outlets, and they range from individual email newsletters all the way to Wikipedia (yes, I'm counting Wikipedia).</p><p>There are a number of drawbacks to getting your news primarily from places like these. For one, it is often more expensive, as outlets like this rely on individual subscriptions and donations to survive. Also, without the history that more established orgs have it can be harder to tell the credibility of a smaller outlet. There is a <em>lot</em> of garbage passing as journalism on Substack, for example. But here's the thing. If you are someone who is smart (you are), you can tell the difference between the good and the bad news.

Make sure you check that out here!\n\nPart I went over how the economic incentives of the news industries create an imbalance between what gets attention and what deserves attention. On a wide scale, it is extraordinarily difficult to disrupt this, but for individuals I believe that it is important to make changes. What follows here is not an outline for new business models (although I do have some thoughts about that lol). It is a resource for individual people to help them make more active, civic-minded decisions in the ways they interact with the world.\n\nWhere we are\n\nAlthough I touched on it in Part I, I want to be more explicit describing the problems that consumers of news are currently facing. Basically it boils down to: private equity dismantling functioning media outlets, mega corporate media conglomeration forcing news to be a profit engine for investors, billionaire owners thumbing the scales of their news outlets and news aggregators to suit their self interests, the disappearance of local news, declining literacy, a concerted right wing, Christian nationalist effort to work the refs, gambling and rampant financial speculation, access journalism, and a presidential administration/legislative branch/Supreme Court that are actively creating the most hostile environment for the First Amendment in living memory.\n\nGot it? Great. Now let's talk about what you can do about it. Here are five suggestions for adjusting your news diet.\n\n\nIndividuals > Brands\n\nYou've probably seen a chart that purports to map the political biases of news organizations. Here's an example of one:\n\nChart source\n\nI don't love these charts. I find it very easy for insincere commentators to look at this and \"both sides\" the hell out of it. \"See! There's extremist conspiracists on both sides!\" But this chart lacks a third axis for influence.\n\nAnother thing that rubs me the wrong way about a chart like this is that, for example, it puts The New York Times as ideologically to the left of NPR and Al Jazeera. I don't need to get into it right now, but that's, uh, kinda wild. There may be individual people at these outlets who align this way, but the institutions on the whole are harder to pin down.\n\nI worry that people come to align with a brand - MSNBC, Fox News, The New Yorker - and not with the individuals who produce work for those brands. Despite the best efforts of editors and producers, the quality of work put out by an outlet can vary widely between different individual people. An opinion piece in the Times written by Jamelle Bouie is very different from a piece by Bret Stephens.\n\nWhat I am trying to stress here is that it is good to find individuals you trust over companies you trust. Doing this allows you to disentangle your news from sides, teams, and in-groups. There is nothing inherently wrong with being on a \"side,\" but aligning oneself internally to the specific ideas of specific people will fight back against the confirmation bias and groupthink that comes from being in an in-group.\n\nOne practical way of doing this is by finding work you enjoy and then finding the creator on social media. Often, you'll find that they have collaborated or uplifted the work of others. This can even come in the form of retweets! Sometimes retweets are endorsements!\n\nHere are some specific people I love following, reading, and watching separate from the companies they may work for: Jon Bois, Jamelle Bouie, Harry Brewis (Hbomberguy), Kashana Cauley, Dana El Kurd, Becca Farsace, Aubrey Gordon, Hank Green, Megan Greenwell, Derek Guy (dieworkwear), Chris Hayes, Michael Hobbes, Marisa Kabas, Mina Kimes, Osita Nwanevu, Jenny Odell, John Oliver, Peter Shamshiri, Olúfẹ́mi O. Táíwò, Jillian C. York.\n\n\nUnderstand the platform\n\nThe difference between a news outlet and a news aggregator is a bit blurrier than it used to be, but I want to use the term \"platform\" here to describe the way you get news.\n\nSo what's a platform? A platform is a place through which you receive the content of your news. So television is a platform. TikTok, YouTube, Twitter, and Reddit are platforms. An old school RSS feeds are a platform. Your podcast app, Google News, Apple News, Instagram, Substack, email newsletters. Even more broadly, your phone is a platform. The platform is not what you're reading/watching/hearing but where and how.\n\nImportantly, platforms often come with their own business models. Linear TV is mostly advertiser funded. Podcasts are mostly advertiser funded with a bit of audience funding. The social media sites are predominantly advertiser funded. Streaming is mostly subscriber funded but increasingly advertiser funded. Email newsletters are most often subscriber funded. And I probably don't need to tell you how your phone ended up in your pocket or your TV against the wall.\n\nAll of these business models come with their own baggage. In exchange for high levels of funding for professionalized producers, advertisers require loads of data and (occasionally) some editorial input. In exchange for personalization and community, podcasts and email newsletters ask for more than just the attention of their audiences.\n\nKnowing how the platform you get your news makes money is key to understanding what stories get told on it.\n\nHere are some platforms I use to get my news: Bluesky, Reddit, Apple News, Techmeme, Mediagazer.\n\n\nHow do you solve a problem like Jeff Bezos?\n\nIt's simple, really. Cancel your WaPo subscription.\n\nFollowing his intrusion on the editorial independence of the opinion writers at his newspaper, a movement started to boycott the Washington Post. Since he nixed the Kamala endorsement in 2024, other actions such as opening up the paper to AI have inspired further cancellations. I am fully aware that the estimated 12% hit that WaPo got in subscribers means very little to the bottom line of a man like Jeff Bezos. Imagine each word in this newsletter represents a million dollars, so that the word \"There's\" in the title represented the first million dollars of Jeff's wealth. When you read the word at the end of this sentence, you'll have hit one billion dollars.\n\nBezos bought the Post for everything written before \"1. Individuals > Brands.\"\n\nAccording to Forbes, his personal wealth would be tallied up by your eyes reading and rereading what you've read so far around 238 times.\n\nThus, the Post represents a vanity project for Jeff, who pushed around its editorial board not because he thought it's what audiences wanted, but because he is a self interested person. We are all self interested people, but not all of us have one of the most storied and highly regarded news outlets in the world to tip the scales for us.\n\nThis is a story just about Jeff, but there are multiple outlets and platforms that are under the influence of whiny crybaby billionaires who, despite offering very little for the labor who make their companies possible, despite offering very little for the planet's resources they are burning, insist that we all agree with them and thank them for sending our pop stars to the edge of space or eroding the good will generated by USAID.\n\nWhile the legacy media institutions are still valuable for their global reach and ability to report facts on the ground, their role as analysts or truth-to-power speakers is profoundly compromised by the likes of Bezos, Trump, Musk, or Murdoch. I do my best to stay away from them and their subsidiaries as much as possible.\n\n\nInvest in independent, non-profit, and cooperatively owned outlets\n\nThe most effective balm against news that is curdled with corporate interest exists. It comes in the form of smaller organizations whose incentive structures are not directly reliant on the mechanisms of the attention economy. There is an entire class of these types of outlets, and they range from individual email newsletters all the way to Wikipedia (yes, I'm counting Wikipedia).\n\nThere are a number of drawbacks to getting your news primarily from places like these. For one, it is often more expensive, as outlets like this rely on individual subscriptions and donations to survive. Also, without the history that more established orgs have it can be harder to tell the credibility of a smaller outlet. There is a lot of garbage passing as journalism on Substack, for example. But here's the thing. If you are someone who is smart (you are), you can tell the difference between the good and the bad news. And for just a few dollars a month you can not only get high quality work, but also stories that are directly relevant to your local area and your interests.\n\nIn fact, this is how I would encourage you to go about this. Look for outlets based on where you live and what you like. Here are some location based examples:\n\n * New York: Hell Gate\n * Washington DC: The 51st\n * Texas: The Texas Observer\n * Minnesota: Minnesota Reformer\n * Chicago: Block Club Chicago\n * California: CalMatters\n\nAnd here are some for particular interests and identity groups:\n\n * Tech: 404Media\n * Music: Hearing Things\n * Trans Issues: Assigned Media\n * Sports: Defector\n * Science: The Xylom\n * Pop Culture: Pop Heist\n\nOne notable characteristic of outlets like this is how personal they feel. When you read them enough, you get to know the people behind them, and it can give you a more supported sense of community than, say, a random meme page on Instagram.\n\nFinally, there are big dogs like ProPublica and DemocracyNow!. These are institutions with history and legacy that do incredibly meaningful, effective work.\n\n\nKnow your opposition\n\nOne of my motivations in helping people build up a better approach to their news is a simple fact: people vote against their interests. You'll see, occasionally, polling on various hot button issues in our country that seems off. Across the board, the majority of Americans favor abortion, favor common sense gun restrictions, favor federally ensured health coverage for all Americans, favor increased taxes on the wealthy. But if majorities favor these things, why are these issues still debated as much as they are? Even factoring for inherent inefficiencies in a bureaucratic democracy such as our own, why don't we see much movement here?\n\nI believe that in order to make our democracy work, we need to spend less time attempting to convince people who disagree with us and more time seeking to understand them.\n\nWhat I am not saying is that you need to go out of your way to understand the likes of Tucker Carlson, Charlie Kirk, or Matt Walsh. Those guys are opportunistic grifter assholes who have found a place being depraved, sad little men. There! You understand them! I am speaking more about their audiences.\n\nEvery so often I make a stop in r/conservative, one of Reddit's largest subreddits for people on the right. While I have been saddened to see the ways in which some people will write about trans people, immigrants, and Democrats generally, it is striking the number of comments from self-identified conservatives that would be right at home in more lefty spaces. There is an extreme animosity for the rich and powerful and a mythic displeasure with What Has Happened To Our Country. There is economic frustration, good faith concern about personal liberty, and alignments around identity. These are all things you'll find in so-called \"blue\" places.\n\nSeeking to know your opposition does not necessarily require you to understand them, per se, but to understand what they are being told. Hate reading/watching is a perfectly viable and natural way to capture this, but always remember that the people who watch Fox News are not the people profiting off of Fox News.\n\nThis is all to say that I believe most opposition in this country is fabricated from legend and storytelling, and in order to sincerely build solidarity, it is required of us to understand the objectionable mythology our potential allies are being fed.\n\nWriting these two pieces has been like pulling teeth. After not writing for a bit, I have been pushing through some serious blocks in order to get these out there. To be honest, they are about 80% of what I want them to be, and there's a ton more nuance I'm not approaching. But I am hopeful that you are the kind of reader who is accepting of ideas in process.\n\nIf you just skipped to the bottom, here's the TL;DR of this piece:\n\n * Current economic incentives cause an imbalance in what deserves and what gets attention\n * It's important to be more civic minded in one's approach to the news\n * Here are some of my tips:\n   * Invest in people over companies and brands.\n   * Understand the economics of your news platform\n   * Avoid the billionaires\n   * Invest time and attention in independent, non-profit, and worker owned media\n   * Seek to understand the opposition's messaging\n\nThat's all for right now, friends. There's so much to talk about here. Much I didn't get to.\n\nOh, and by the way, if every character in this piece accounted for one million Jeff Bezos dollars, the period at the end of this sentence only gets you to around $13 billion
